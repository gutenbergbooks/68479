<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE TO AMERICAN EDITION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Prophecy</span> of an event is unlikely to be interesting
after it and this may be the reason why my prophetic
utterances regarding the Great War took the
form of Satire. The first of these fables has a history.
It was published originally in London as a little
orange-covered booklet, called Old Mole’s Novel
and it was issued simultaneously with Old Mole, a
character to whom I was so attached that it gave
me great pleasure to attribute authorship to him.
Only a small edition was printed and it soon ran out
of print. A copy of it reached Germany and fell
into the hands of a group of young men who were
incensed by the nonsense the high-born Generals and
Admirals were talking in the Reichstag and I received
enthusiastic letters asking for more so that
these caustic prophecies might circulate in Germany
and serve as an antidote. That was more encouragement
than I had received in England and so, for
my German friends, who had the advantage of living
under a frank and not a veiled Junkerdom, I composed
the remaining fables and finished them a few
months before the outbreak of war. The translation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
was proceeded with but so far as I know the
book was never issued in Germany. It appeared in
England early in 1915 and this intensely patriotic
effort of mine was condemned as unpatriotic because
we had already caught the German trick of talking
of war as holy. It sold not at all in its first expensive
edition because it was not a novel, nor an essay,
nor a play and the British public had no training
in Satire, but I have since had letters from both soldiers
and conscientious objectors saying that the
book was their constant companion and solace,
and I have recently learned that in a certain division
of the British Army it was declared to be a court-martial
offense for any officer to have the book in
his possession, presumably on the principle that the
soldier must not read anything which his superiors
cannot understand. That of course was good for
the sale of the book and the cheap edition also ran
out of print just about the time when the shortage
of paper produced a crisis in the affairs of authors
and publishers.</p>

<p>The book was useful to me when the time came
as evidence that my objection to war was not an
objection to personal discomfort, the element of
danger, owing to my ill health, not arising as a point
at issue, though that would not have made any difference
to my position. My objection to war is that
it does not do what its advocates say it does, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
that no good cause can be served by it. Good
causes can only be served by patience, endurance,
sympathy, understanding, mind and will.</p>

<p>The attempt to remove militarism and military
conceptions from among human preoccupations
is a good cause and that I will serve with the only
weapon I know how to use—the pen, which they
say is mightier than the sword or even the howitzer.
Having applied myself to this service before the
outbreak of the Great War, which for me began in
1911, I was not to be diverted from it by the panic
confusion of those who were overtaken by the calamity
rather than prepared for it. With Windmills,
my essay on Satire, my critical study of Samuel
Butler, the Interlude in Old Mole, I was an active
participant in the Great War before it began, but of
course no one pays any attention to a prophet, especially
when he is enough of an artist to desire to
give his prophecy permanent form. That indeed
was my mistake. Had I thundered in the accents
of Horatio Bottomley instead of clipping my sentences
to the mocking murmur of satire I might have
been a hero to some one else’s valet, not having one
of my own. Peace has her Bottomleys no less renowned
than war, but I am afraid I am not among
their number, for I have long since returned to the
serious business of life, the composition of dramatic
works, and I am in the position that most ensures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
unpopularity, that of being able to say ‘I told you
so.’</p>

<p>I am a little alarmed when I consider how closely
the Great War followed my prophecy of it and turn
to the fables, Gynecologia and Out of Work,
which follow logically from the other. A world
governed by women as lopsidedly as it has been by
men would be much like that depicted here, and the
final collapse, if it came, would surely follow the
lines indicated in Out of Work. None of us knows
exactly of what we are a portent and who can imagine
to what Lady Astor’s flight into fame may lead?
If I had not already dedicated this book to my
friend D. H. Lawrence I would, without her permission,
inscribe upon it the name of the first woman to
take her Seat in the worst club in London, the
House of Commons.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I: TITTIKER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">George Samways</span> awoke one night with a vague
distressful feeling that all was not well with his
island. The moon was shining, but it was casting
the shadow of the palm tree in which he slept over
the hollow wherein he cooked his meals, and that
had never happened before.</p>

<p>He was alarmed and climbed down his palm tree
and ran to the tall hill from which he was accustomed
to observe the sea and the land that floated
blue on the edge of the sea. The ascent seemed
longer than usual, and when he reached the summit
he was horrified to find a still higher peak before
him. At this sight he was overcome with emotion
and lay upon the earth and sobbed. When he could
sob no more he rose to his feet and dragged himself
to the top of the furthest peak and gazed out upon
an empty sea. The moon was very bright. There
was no land upon the edge of the sea. He raised
his eyes heavenwards. The stars were moving.
He looked round upon his island. It was shrunk,
and the forests were uprooted and the little lake at
the foot of the hill had disappeared. Before and
behind his island the sea was churned and tumbled, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
it was when he pressed his hands against the little
waves when he went into the water to cleanse himself.</p>

<p>And now a wind came and a storm arose; rain
came beating, and he hastened back to the hole in
the ground he had dug for himself against foul
weather. Then, knowing that he would not sleep,
he lit his lamp of turtle oil and pith and read <i>Tittiker</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tittiker</i> was the book left to him by his father
whom he had put into the ground many years before,
even as he had seen his father do with his
mother when he was a little child. He had been
born on the island, and could just remember his
mother, and his father had lived long enough to
teach him how to fish and hunt and make his clothes
of leaves, feathers, and skins, and to read in <i>Tittiker</i>,
but not long enough to give him any clue to the
meaning of the book. But whenever he was sad it
was a great solace to him, and he had read it from
cover to cover forty times, for it was like talking to
somebody else, and it was full of names and titles,
to which he had attached personages, so that the island
was very thickly populated. Through <i>Tittiker</i>
he knew that the earth moved round the sun,
that the moon moved round the earth and made the
tides, that there were three hundred and sixty-five
days in the year, seven days in the week, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">II: THE BISHOP</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, the next morning, he crawled out of his lair
he saw a man strangely clad in black, with a shiny
corded hat on his head and an apron hanging from
his middle to his knees, gazing up into his palm tree
and down into his kitchen. The man in black saw
him and, in the language of <i>Tittiker</i>, said:</p>

<p>“Alas, my poor brother!”</p>

<p>“Are you my brother?” asked George.</p>

<p>The man in black stepped back in amazement.</p>

<p>“You speak Fattish?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I have had no one to speak to for many years,”
replied George; “but my father spoke as you do.”</p>

<p>“Let us pray,” said the man in black, kneeling
down on the sands.</p>

<p>“Pray? What is that?”</p>

<p>“To God. Surely you are acquainted with the
nature of God?”</p>

<p>The word occurred in <i>Tittiker</i>.</p>

<p>“I often wondered what it was,” said George.</p>

<p>“Ssh!” said the man in black soothingly. “See!
I will tell you. God made the world in six days and
rested the seventh day....”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“It took me nearly six days to dig my father’s
grave, and then I was very tired.”</p>

<p>“Ssh! Ssh! Listen.... God made the world
in six days, and last of all he made man and set him
to live in his nakedness and innocence by the sweat
of his brow. But man ate of the fruit of the tree
of knowledge and became acquainted with original
sin in the form of a serpent, and his descendants
were born, lived and died in wickedness and were reduced
to so terrible a plight that God in His mercy
sent His son to point the way to salvation. God’s
son was crucified by the Jews, was wedded to the
Church, and, leaving His bride to carry His name
all over the world and bring lost sheep home to the
fold, ascended into Heaven. But first He descended
into Hell to show that the soul might be
saved even after damnation, and He rose again the
third day. His Church, after many vicissitudes,
reached the faithful people of Fatland, which for all
it is a little island off the continent of Europe, has
created the greatest Empire the world has ever seen.
The Fattish people have been favoured with the
only true Church, whose officers and appointed ministers
are deacons, priests, rural deans, prebendaries,
canons, archdeacons, deans, bishops, archbishops.
I am a Bishop.”</p>

<p>“All that,” said George, “is in <i>Tittiker</i>.”</p>

<p>And he recited the names and salaries of six dioceses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
but when he came to the seventh the Bishop
blushed and bade him forbear.</p>

<p>“That,” he said, “is my diocese.” And he
swelled out and looked down his nose and made
George feel very uncomfortable, so that to bridge
the difficulty he went back to the Bishop’s story.</p>

<p>“I like that,” he said. “And Hell is such a
good word. I never heard it before.”</p>

<p>“Hell,” replied the Bishop, “is the place of damnation.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my father used to say ‘damnation.’”</p>

<p>“Ssh!”</p>

<p>“There is something about Jews in <i>Tittiker</i>, but
what is original sin?”</p>

<p>The Bishop looked anxiously from left to right
and from right to left and in a very low, earnest
voice he said:</p>

<p>“Are there no women on your island?”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">III: ARABELLA</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> as the Bishop spoke there came round the
point a creature than whom George had not even
dreamed of any more fair. But her garments
seemed to him absurd, because they clung about her
nether limbs so as to impede their action. She
came with little steps toward them, crying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Father!”</p>

<p>“My child! Not dead!”</p>

<p>“No, dear father. I have been drying myself
over there. I have been weeping for you. I
thought I was the only one saved.”</p>

<p>“So I thought of myself. What a wonderful
young woman you are! You look as if you were
going district visiting, so neat you are.”</p>

<p>George was staring at her with all his eyes.
Never had he heard more lovely sounds than those
that came from her lips.</p>

<p>“My daughter, Arabella,” said the Bishop.</p>

<p>She held out her hand. George touched it fearfully
as though he dreaded lest she should melt
away.</p>

<p>“I like you,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m so hungry,” cried Arabella.</p>

<p>“I could eat an ox,” declared the Bishop.</p>

<p>George produced a kind of bread that he made
from seeds, and the leg of a goat, and went off to
the creek near by to fetch some clams. He also
caught a crab and they had a very hearty breakfast,
washed down with the milk of cocoanuts. The
Bishop had explained the situation to Arabella, and
she said:</p>

<p>“And am I really the first woman you have ever
seen!”</p>

<p>“I had a mother,” replied George simply, “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
she was not beautiful like you. She dressed differently
and her legs were fat and strong.”</p>

<p>“There, there!” said the Bishop. But Arabella
laughed merrily.</p>

<p>The Bishop told how they had been with nineteen
other Bishops and their families upon a cruise in the
steam-yacht <i>Oyster</i>, each Bishop engaging to preach
on Sundays to the lay passengers, and how the propeller
had been broken and they had been carried
out of their course and tossed this way and that, and
finally wrecked (he thought) with the loss of all
hands, though the wireless operator had stuck to his
post to the last and managed to get off the tidings
of the calamity with latitude and longitude into the
air.</p>

<p>It all conveyed very little to George, but it was an
acute pleasure to him to hear their voices, and as
they talked he looked from one to the other with a
happy, friendly smile.</p>

<p>He was very proud to show his island to his visitors,
but distressed at the havoc wrought by the
storm, and he apologised for its unusual behaviour
in moving.</p>

<p>“It has never done it before,” he explained, and
was rather hurt because Arabella laughed.</p>

<p>He showed them where, as far as he could remember,
his father and mother lay buried, and he took
them to the top of the hill, and to amuse them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
caught a goat and a little kind of kangaroo there
was in the forest, and a turtle. He displayed his
hammock in the palm tree and showed how he curled
up in it and wedged himself in so as not to fall out,
and promised to prepare two other trees for them.
They demurred. The Bishop asked if he might
have the lair, and Arabella asked George to build
her a house. He did not know what a house was,
but looked it up in <i>Tittiker</i> and could find mention
only of the House of Swells and the House of Talk.
Arabella made a little house of sand; he caught the
idea and spent the day weaving her a cabin of palm
branches and mud and pebbles. He sang whole
passages from <i>Tittiker</i> as he worked, and when it
was finished he led Arabella to the cabin and she
smiled so dazzlingly that he reeled, but quickly recovered
himself, remembered as in a vision how it
had been with his mother, flung his arms round her
neck and kissed her, saying:</p>

<p>“I love you.”</p>

<p>“I think we had better look for my father,” said
Arabella.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IV: THE SKITISH NAVY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> three nights did the Bishop sleep in the lair
and Arabella in her cabin. A grey scrub grew on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Bishop’s chin, and during the daytime he instructed
George solemnly and heavily as he delivered himself
of his invariable confirmation address,—(on
the second day he baptised George in the creek, and
Arabella was delighted to be his god-mother)—with
an eager pride as he told him of the Skitish
Isles where his diocese and the seat of the Empire
lay. The United Kingdom, he said, consisted of
four countries, Fatland, Smugland, Bareland, and
Snales, but only Fatland mattered, because the Fattish
absorbed the best of the Smugs and the Barish
and the Snelsh and found jobs for the cleverest of
them in Bondon or Buntown, which was the greatest
city in the world. He assured George that he might
go down on his knees and thank God—now that
he was baptised—for having been born a Fattishman,
and that if they ever returned to Bondon he
would receive a reward for having added to the
Skitish Empire.</p>

<p>George knew all about the Emperor-King and his
family, and liked the idea of giving his island as a
present. He asked the Bishop if he thought the
Emperor-King would give him Arabella.</p>

<p>“That,” said the Bishop, “does not rest with the
Emperor-King.”</p>

<p>“But I want her,” answered George.</p>

<p>Thereafter the Bishop was careful never to leave
his daughter alone, so that at last she protested and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
said she found Mr. Samways very interesting and
was perfectly able to take care of herself.</p>

<p>So she was, and next time George kissed her she
gave him a motherly caress in return and he was
more than satisfied; he was in an ecstasy of happiness
and danced to please her and showed her all the
little tricks he had invented to while away the tedium
of his solitude, as lying on his back with a great
stone on his feet and kicking it into the air, and walking
on his knees with his feet in his hands, and
thrusting his toe into his mouth. He was downcast
when she asked him not to repeat some of his tricks.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, for want of any other employment,
the Bishop decided to confirm George, who
consented willingly when he learned that Arabella
had been confirmed. The ceremony impressed him
greatly, and he had just resolved never to have anything
to do with Original Sin when a terrifying
boom broke in upon their solemnity. Some such
noise had preceded the detachment of the island,
and George ran like a goat to the top of the hill,
whence, bearing down, he saw a dark grey vessel
belching smoke and casting up a great wave before
and leaving a white spume aft. Also on the side of
the island away from his dwelling he saw two sticks
above water, and knew, from the Bishop’s description,
that it must be the steam-yacht <i>Oyster</i>. He
hastened back with the news, and presently the vessel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
hove in sight of the beach, and it conceived and
bare a little vessel which put out and came over the
waves to the shore. A handsome man all gold and
blue stepped out of the little vessel and planted a
stick with a piece of cloth on it on the sands and
said:</p>

<p>“I claim this island for the Skitish Empire.”</p>

<p>“This island,” said the Bishop, “is the property
of Mr. George Samways.”</p>

<p>“Damme,” roared the man in gold and blue, “it
isn’t on the chart.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Samways was born here,” said Arabella
with the most charming smile.</p>

<p>“Yes.” George saw the man glance approvingly
at Arabella and was anxious to assert himself.
“Yes, I was born on the island, but it broke loose
in a storm.”</p>

<p>The officer roared again, the Bishop protested,
the men in the boat grinned, and at last Arabella
took the affair in hand and explained that her father
was the Bishop of Bygn and that they had been in
the ill-fated <i>Oyster</i>.</p>

<p>The officer removed his hat and begged pardon.
They had received messages from the <i>Oyster</i>, but
the bearings were wrongly reported. Sighting land
not marked on the chart, they had decided to turn in
to annex it, but, of course, if Mr. Samways were a
Skitish subject that would be unnecessary, and—hum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
ha!—All’s well that ends well and it was extremely
fortunate.</p>

<p>Arabella said that Mr. Samways was not only a
Skitish subject but a member of the Church of Fatland,
and would be only too pleased to hand over his
island to the Colonial or whatever office might desire
to govern it. Mr. Samways was, so far, the
island’s whole permanent population and would
gladly give all particulars. For herself she was only
anxious to return to Fatland, and was excited at the
prospect of travelling on board one of the Emperor-King’s
ships of war. Meanwhile would Mr. ——</p>

<p>“Bich.”</p>

<p>—would Mr. Bich stay to luncheon?</p>

<p>Mr. Bich stayed to luncheon. In the afternoon
he made a rough survey of the island, sounded the
surrounding waters, declared that movement had
ceased, and that so far as he could make out the
island was fast on a submarine reef, with which it
had collided so violently that a promontory had
cracked and was even now sinking, and with it the
<i>Oyster</i>.</p>

<p>Careful examination of the shore on that side of
the island revealed no more than the bodies of two
Lascars, two nailbrushes, a corded silk hat, a Bible,
a keg of rum and five tins of condensed milk. In
that awful shipwreck had perished nineteen Bishops
and their families, a hundred and ten members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the professional and trading classes, the crew, the
captain, mates, and a cat.</p>

<p>They stood there on that wild shore amid the solitude
of sea and sky, the Skitish officer, the Bishop,
Arabella, and George Samways, and their emotions
were too deep for words.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">V: CAPTAIN COURAGEOUS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ship lay-to, and, while the Captain and Mr.
Bich discussed the island in the language of their
trade, the Bishop, whenever possible, preached a
sermon, or discoursed on the beauties of nature; but
Arabella took George under her protection, had his
hair cut and his beard shaved, and with a smile
bought of the youngest sub-lieutenant a suit of his
shore-going clothes, a set of shirts, collars, and all
necessary under-garments. George found them
most uncomfortable, but bore with them for her
sake.</p>

<p>As the result of the eloquence of Mr. Bich the
Captain went ashore and returned to report that,
the promontory now having sunk to the depths of the
ocean, a very decent harbour had been made and the
island would be valuable to the Empire as a coaling-station.
His pockets were bulging when he came
aboard, and Arabella elicited from Mr. Bich that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the island was rich in precious stones and metals,
and that the pebbles of which her cabin had been
built were emeralds and aquamarines such as had
never before been seen. Arabella told her father,
and he bade her say nothing, adding impressively:</p>

<p>“We must protect Mr. Samways’ interests.”</p>

<p>But George was thinking of nothing but the best
means of obliterating Mr. Bich, upon whom it
seemed to him that Arabella was casting a too favourable
eye.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VI: HOSTILITIES</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the ship steamed away from the island the smoke
of another vessel was sighted. It was signalled, but
no reply was hoisted. There was great excitement
on board and the chief gunner said:</p>

<p>“Let me have a go at them.”</p>

<p>The Captain stood upon the bridge, a figure of
calm dignity with a telescope to his eye. Mr. Bich
explained to Arabella and George that the ship was
a Fatter ship, and that the Fatters had lately been
taking islands on the sly without saying anything to
anybody, because they were jealous of the Skitish
Empire and wanted to have one too.</p>

<p>“Do islands make an Empire?” asked George.</p>

<p>“Anything you can get,” replied Mr. Bich.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>The Fatter ship was making for the island.
After her went the grey vessel, and it was a nose-to-nose
race who should first reach the harbour. The
Fatter ship won. The grey vessel fired a gun.
The gig was lowered and the Captain, looking very
grim and determined, put off in her.... Arabella
dropped a pin and it was heard all over the vessel.
It was a relief to all on board when the Bishop knelt
and offered up a prayer for the Captain’s safety.
The Amen that came at the end of it brought the
tears to George’s eyes, and his blood ran cold when
it swelled into a cheer as the Captain’s gig broke
loose from the Fatter ship and came tearing over
the smooth waters.</p>

<p>The Captain’s face was very white as he stepped
on deck and called Mr. Bich and the other officers
to his state-room, and whiter still were the faces of
Mr. Bich and the officers when they left it. The
vessel shook with the vibration of the engines: there
was a strange and stormy muttering among the men:
the vessel headed for the open sea. George was
taken to his cabin and locked in. He lay down on
the floor and tried to go to sleep. A roaring and a
rumbling and a banging and a thudding made that
impossible. The shaking made him feel so sick that
he wished to die. Near by he could hear Arabella
weeping, and that was more than he could bear.
He thrust and bumped against his door and worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
himself into a sweat over it, but it seemed that it
would not give. As he reached the very pit of despair,
the door gave, the floor gave, the walls heaved
in upon him; in one roaring convulsion he was flung
up and up and up, and presently came down and
down and down into the sea. It tasted salt and was
cool to his sweating body and he was glad of it.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VII: SIEBENHAAR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was not glad of it for long, because he soon became
very cold and was nipped to numbness. He
assumed that it was the end, and felt a remote regret
for Arabella. Other thought he had none.</p>

<p>When he came to himself he was, or seemed to be,
once more in the room from which he had been so
violently propelled, but there were two men standing
near him and talking in a strange tongue. Presently
there came a third man who spoke to him in
Fattish.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Thought you were done in,” said the
man.</p>

<p>George stared.</p>

<p>“Done in. Dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was.”</p>

<p>The man laughed.</p>

<p>“Funny fellow you are. Eyes just like a baby.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Where is Arabella?” asked George. “Where
am I?”</p>

<p>“Give you three guesses,” said the man.</p>

<p>“On a ship?”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“The Emperor-King’s ship?”</p>

<p>“No. The King-Emperor’s. You have the
honour to be the first prisoner in the great Fattero-Fattish
war.”</p>

<p>“War? What is that?”</p>

<p>“War? You don’t know what war is? Have
you never read a newspaper?”</p>

<p>“I have only read <i>Tittiker</i>. It tells about a War
Office, but I never knew what it was for.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Siebenhaar, engineer and philosophical
student, and I fancy you are the man I have been
looking for all my life. You should be capable of a
pure idea....”</p>

<p>“What,” asked George, “is an idea?”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar flung his arms around him and embraced
him and recited a long poem in his own language.</p>

<p>“You shall be presented at the Universities!” he
said. “You shall be a living reproach to all writers,
thinkers, artists, and I, Siebenhaar, will be your
humble attendant.”</p>

<p>“Did I say anything unusual?”</p>

<p>“Unusual? Unique! Colossal! The ultimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
question! ‘What is war? What is an idea?’
Ach?”</p>

<p>George insisted on an explanation of the meaning
of war, and then he asked why the Fattish and the
Fatters should be intent upon mutual destruction,
and also what the difference between them might be.</p>

<p>“Difference?” said Siebenhaar. “The Fattish
drink beer that you can hold; the Fatters drink beer
that runs through you. That is all there is to it.”</p>

<p>With that he sent for some Fatter beer and drank
a large quantity himself and made George taste it.
He spat it out.</p>

<p>“Is that why they are making war?”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar smacked his lips.</p>

<p>“Man,” he said, “is the creature of his internal
organs, almost, I might say, their slave. The lungs,
the heart, the kidneys, the stomach, the bladder,
these control a man, and every day refashion him.
If they do their work well, so does he. If they do
it ill, then so does he. Each of the organs has secretions
which periodically choke their interaction,
and bring about a state of ill-humour and discomfort
in which the difference between man and man
is accentuated, and their good relations degenerate
into hatred and envy and distrust. At such times
murders are committed and horrible assaults, but
frequently discretion prevails over those desires,
suppresses them but does not destroy them. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
accumulate and find expression in war, which has
been led up to by a series of actions on the part of
men suffering from some internal congestion. Modern
war, they say, is made by money, and the lust for
it. That is no explanation. No man becomes a
victim of the lust for money except something interferes
with his more natural lusts: no man, I go so
far as to say, could so desire money as to become a
millionaire except he were const——”</p>

<p>“But what has this to do with beer?” interrupted
George.</p>

<p>“I’m coming to that,” continued Siebenhaar.</p>

<p>“Beer taken in excess is a great getter of secretions,
and man is so vain an animal as to despise
those whose secretions differ from his own. What
is more obvious than that the implacable enemies of
the Eastern hemisphere should be those whose drink
is so much the same but so profoundly different in
its effects? Internal congestion may bring about
war, but in this war the material is undoubtedly supplied
by beer. And I may add, in support of my
theory, that once war is embarked upon, those engaged
in it suffer so terribly from internal disorganisation
as to become unanswerable for their actions,
and so mad as to rejoice in the near prospect of a
violent death. Moltke was notoriously decayed inside
and the state of Napoleon’s internal organs will
not bear thinking on.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>George protested that he had never heard of
Napoleon or Moltke, and Siebenhaar was on the
point of embracing him, when, muttering something
about Fatter beer, he rose abruptly and left the
room.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VIII: MORE OF SIEBENHAAR</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span> is a woman aboard,” said Siebenhaar when
he returned. “I suppose you have never seen a
woman?”</p>

<p>“Two,” said George simply.</p>

<p>Siebenhaar slapped his leg.</p>

<p>“Have you any theory about them?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Theory? I don’t know what theory is. I
loved them. I put my arms round their necks and
rubbed my face against their soft faces. It was
very nice. I should like to do it every night before
I go to sleep. I should like to do it now.”</p>

<p>“You shall,” said Siebenhaar, and he went out
and came back with Arabella.</p>

<p>George leaped from his berth and flung his arms
round her neck and embraced her, and she was so
surprised and delighted that she kissed him, and
Siebenhaar wept to see it.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who you are, madam,” he said,
“but if I were you I should stick to that young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
like a barnacle to a ship’s bottom. I would creep
into his heart and curl up in it like a grub in a ripe
raspberry, and I would go down on my knees and
thank Heaven for having sent me the one man in the
modern world who may be capable of a genuine and
constant affection. You have him, madam, straight
from his mother’s arms, with a soul, a heart, as virgin
as I hope your own are.”</p>

<p>Arabella disengaged herself from George’s now
ardent embrace, drew herself up, and with the haughtiness
of her race, said:</p>

<p>“My father was a bishop of the Church of Fatland.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Siebenhaar, “does not exempt you
from the normal internal economy of your sex or its
need of the (perfectly honest) love of the opposite
sex. My point is that you have here an unrivalled
opportunity of meeting an honest love, and I implore
you to take it.”</p>

<p>“I would have you know,” retorted Arabella,
“that I am engaged to my late father’s chaplain.”</p>

<p>“War,” said Siebenhaar, “is war, and I should
advise you to seek protection where it is offered.”</p>

<p>“If you would hold my hand in yours,” said
George to Arabella, “I think I should sleep now. I
am so tired.”</p>

<p>Arabella held George’s hand and in two minutes
he was asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IX: SIEBENHAAR ON WOMEN</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span> are some,” said Siebenhaar, “who regard
women as a disease, a kind of fungoid distortion of
the human form. But only the very lowest species
are hermaphrodite, and the higher seem to be split
up into male and female for the purpose of reproduction
without temporary loss of efficiency in the
task of procuring food. The share of the male in
the act of reproduction is soon over, and among the
wisest inhabitants of the globe the male is destroyed
as soon as his share is performed. Human beings
are not very wise: they have an exaggerated idea of
their importance; and they are reluctant to destroy
the life of their kind except in occasional outbursts
of organised homicide such as that on which we are
now engaged. The share of the female entails the
devotion of many months, during which she needs
the protection of the male, whom, for that reason,
and also because she hopes to repeat the performance,
she retains by every art at her disposal.
Hence has arisen the institution of marriage, which
pledges the male to the protection of the female
and their offspring. Whether a moral principle is
engaged in this institution is a question upon which
philosophers cannot agree. It is therefore left out
of most systems of philosophy. Mine is based on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
my answer to it, which is that there is no moral principle
engaged. Morality is for the few who are
capable of it. Few men have the capacity for ideas,
but all men love women, except a few miserable degenerates,
who prefer a substitute. There is no
idea in marriage. It is an expedient. Sensible
communities admit of open relief from it; in duller
communities relief has to be sought in the byways.
And still no moral principle is engaged. It is a matter
only of supplying the necessities of human nature.
Now, love is a different affair altogether. Love is
an idea, a direct inspiration. It alone can transcend
the tyranny of the internal organs and lead a man
not only to perceive his limitations but within them
to create beauty, and creative a man must be directly
he becomes aware of the heat of love in the heart of
a woman. There is no other such purging fire, none
that can so illuminate the dark places of the world
or so concentrate and distil such lightness as there
is. All evil, I have said, comes from congestion; to
release the good a purge is necessary, and there is
no purge like woman. Therefore, madam, I do
most solemnly charge you to tend the fire of love in
your heart. Never again will you find a man so
sensible to its warmth—(most men can see no
difference between love and indigestion)—Oh,
madam, discard all thoughts of marriage, which is
an expedient of prudence, which is cowardice, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
modesty, which is a lure, of innocence, which in an
adult female is a lie, to the winds, do exactly as you
feel inclined to do, and love. Madam ——”</p>

<p>But by this Arabella was asleep. She had sunk
back against George, her lovely tresses lay upon his
shoulder, and her hand clasped his.</p>

<p>Siebenhaar wiped away a tear, heaved a great
sigh, took his beer-mug in his hand and crept away
on tip-toe.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">X: LOVE</h3>


<h3 class="nobreak">XI: MUSIC</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> deck was a band playing dirge-like dragging
hymns, for the Admiral of that ship was a very pious
man and believed that the Almighty was personally
directing the war against the enemies of Fatterland,
and would be encouraged to hear that ship’s
company taking him seriously.</p>

<p>No sooner did Siebenhaar set foot on deck than
he was arrested.</p>

<p>The Chaplain had listened to every word of his
discourse and reported it to the Admiral, who detested
Siebenhaar because he was always laughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and was very popular with the crew. Word for
word the Chaplain had quoted Siebenhaar’s sayings,
so that he could deny nothing but only protest that
it was purely a private matter, a series of opinions
and advice given gratuitously to an interesting
couple.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” roared the Admiral, “is given to the
enemies of our country.”</p>

<p>“We are all human,” said Siebenhaar. “I was
carried away by the discovery of human feeling
amid the callousness of this pompous war.”</p>

<p>The Admiral went pale. The Chaplain shuddered.
The officers hid their faces.</p>

<p>“He has spoken against God’s holy war,” said
the Chaplain.</p>

<p>“That’s all my eye,” said Siebenhaar. “Why
drag God into it? You are making war simply because
you have so many ships that you are ashamed
not to use them. The armament companies want
to build more ships and can invent no other way of
getting rid of them.”</p>

<p>“God has given us ships of war,” said the Chaplain,
“even as He has given us the good grain and
the fish of the sea. Who are we that we should not
use them?”</p>

<p>The sub-Chaplain had been sent to discover the
effect of Siebenhaar’s advice upon the enemies of
Fatterland. The accused had just opened his mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to resume his defence when the sub-Chaplain returned
and whispered into the ear of his chief.</p>

<p>“God help us all!” cried the Chaplain. “They
are desecrating His ship!”</p>

<p>There was a whispered consultation. George
and Arabella were brought before the court, and if
George was the object of general execration, Arabella
won the admiration of all eyes, especially the
Admiral’s, who regarded his affections as his own
particular, private and peculiar devil and was now
tempted by him. The Chaplain held forth at great
length; the Admiral grunted in apostrophe. Only
Siebenhaar could interpret. He said:</p>

<p>“They say we have blasphemed their God of
War. I by giving advice, you by acting on it. It is
not good to be fortunate and favoured among hundreds
of mateless males. It will go hard with us.”</p>

<p>“And Arabella?” asked George.</p>

<p>“They will keep Arabella,” replied Siebenhaar.</p>

<p>They were silenced.</p>

<p>A boat was stocked with corned beef, biscuits,
and water. George and Siebenhaar were placed in
it and it was lowered. The band resumed its playing
of dirge-like dragging hymns, and through the
wailing of the oboes and the cornet-à-piston George
could hear the sobs of Arabella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XII: ADRIFT</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Now</span>,” said Siebenhaar, “you have an opportunity
to exercise your national prerogative and rule the
waves.”</p>

<p>George made no reply. His internal organs were
supplying him with an illustration of Siebenhaar’s
theory. The waves did just as they liked with the
boat, sent it spinning in one direction, wrenched it
back in another, slipped from under it, picked it up
again and every now and then playfully sent a
drenching spray over its occupants.</p>

<p>Siebenhaar talked, sang and slept, and, when he
was doing none of these things, ate voraciously.</p>

<p>“I insist on dying with a full stomach,” he said
when George protested.</p>

<p>George ate and slept and thought of Arabella,
when he could think at all.</p>

<p>“Death,” said Siebenhaar, “must be very surprising:
but then, so is life when you penetrate its
disguises and discover its immutability. We hate
death only because it is impossible to pretend that it
is something else, so that it comes at the end of the
comedy to give us the lie. After this experience I
think I shall change my philosophy and seek the
truth of life with the light of death. You never
know: it might become fashionable. Women like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
their thoughts ready-made, and they like them
bizarre. Women are undoubtedly superior to
men....”</p>

<p>But by this time George was in such a state of discomfort
that he lay flat on his face in the bottom
of the boat and groaned:</p>

<p>“I am going to die.”</p>

<p>“Eat,” said Siebenhaar, “eat and drink.” And
he offered corned beef and water.</p>

<p>“I want to die,” moaned George, and he wept
because death would not come at once. He hid his
face in his hands and howled and roared. Siebenhaar
himself ate the corned beef and drank the
water, and went on eating and drinking until he had
exhausted all their supply. Then he curled up in
the bows and went to sleep and snored.</p>

<p>And the waves changed their mood and gave the
boat only a gentle rocking.</p>

<p>George opened his eyes and gazed up into the sky.
It was night and the stars were shining brilliantly.
Red and yellow and white they were and they danced
above him. He was astonished to find that he did
not wish to die. He was very hungry. He crawled
over to Siebenhaar and shook him and woke him up.</p>

<p>There was neither food nor water in the locker.</p>

<p>“In the great cities of the civilised world,” said
Siebenhaar, “there are occasional performers who
go without food for forty days. We shall see.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“I am thirsty,” whimpered George.</p>

<p>“Those occasional performers,” returned Siebenhaar,
“drink water and smoke cigarettes, and they
are sheltered from the elements by walls of glass.
We shall see.”</p>

<p>With that he turned over and went to sleep again.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIII: HUNGER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">George’s</span> face was sunk and his eyes glared. Siebenhaar
tried to spit into the sea, but it was impossible.
He was daunted into silence.</p>

<p>Another day began to dawn.</p>

<p>“If this goes on,” said George in a dry whistling
croak of a voice, “I shall eat you.”</p>

<p>And he glared so at Siebenhaar’s throat that the
philosopher turned up his coat collar to cover it.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIV: MILITARY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> dawn a shower of rain came. They collected
water in George’s boots. They had already eaten
Siebenhaar’s.</p>

<p>Thus revived, George stood up, and on the edge
of the sea saw blue land and little white sails. They
came nearer and nearer, and presently they were delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
by a little vessel that contained one white
man and ten negroes. Neither George nor Siebenhaar
could speak, but they pointed to their bellies
and were given to eat.</p>

<p>“I recant,” said Siebenhaar. “There is nothing
to be learnt from death, for death is nothing. The
stomach is lord of life and master of the world.”</p>

<p>With that he recounted their adventures and
the reason for their being in such a woeful plight.
The master of the ship, on learning that Siebenhaar
was a Fatter, said that he must deliver him up
as a prisoner when they reached Cecilia, the capital
of the Fattish colony which they would see as soon
as the fleet—for it was a fishing fleet—turned into
the bay.</p>

<p>“As a Philosopher,” said Siebenhaar, “I have no
nationality. As an engineer—but I am no longer
an engineer. The Admiral and the Chaplain will
have seen to that. My life is now devoted to Mr.
Samways, as in a certain narrower sense it has nearly
been.” And he told the master of the ship how
George was by birth the proprietor of the island in
dispute between the two nations, and how the island
shone with precious stones and glittered with a
mountain of gold. The master’s cupidity was
aroused, and he agreed to grant Siebenhaar his liberty
on the promise of a rich reward at the conclusion
of the war. He was a Fattishman, and could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
not believe that there would be any other end than
a Fattish triumph.</p>

<p>A pact was signed and they sailed into Cecilia, the
governor of which colony was Siebenhaar’s cousin
and delighted to see him and to have a chance of
talking the Fatter language and indulging in philosophical
speculations for which his Fattish colleagues
had no taste. He welcomed George warmly on his
first entry in a civilised land, and was delighted to instruct
him in the refinements of Fattish manners:
how you did not eat peas or gravy with your knife,
and how (roughly speaking) no portion of the body
between the knees and shoulders might be mentioned
in polite society, and how sneezing and coughing
and the like sudden affections were to be checked or
disguised. George talked of Arabella and the wonderful
stir of the emotions she had caused in him.
Colonel Sir Gerard Schweinfleisch (for that was his
name) was greatly shocked, and told how in the best
Fattish society all talk of love was forbidden, left by
the men to the women, and how among men the emotions
were never discussed, and how, since it was impossible
to avoid all mention of that side of life, men
in civilisation had invented a system of droll stories
which both provided amusement and put a stop to
the embarrassment of intimate revelations.</p>

<p>However, as George’s vigour was restored by the
good food he ate in enormous quantities, he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
not forbear to think of Arabella or to talk of her.
He spoke quite simply of her to a company of
officers, and they roared with laughter and found it
was the best story they had ever heard.</p>

<p>When the officers were not telling droll stories,
they were playing cards or ball games or boasting
one against the other or talking about money.</p>

<p>George asked what money was, and they showed
him some. He was disappointed. He had expected
something much more remarkable because
they had been so excited about it. They told him he
must have money, and Colonel Sir Gerard Schweinfleisch
gave him a sovereign. A man in the street
asked George to lend him a sovereign and George
gave it to him. The officers were highly amused.</p>

<p>The adventurers had not been in Cecilia above
a week when the town was besieged and presently
bombarded. Except that there was a shortage of
food and that every day at least thirty persons were
killed, there was no change in the life of the place.
The officers told droll stories and played cards or
ball games or boasted one against the other or
talked about money. They ate, drank, slept, and
quarrelled, and George found them not so very much
unlike himself except that he was serious about his
love for Arabella, while they laughed. He asked
Siebenhaar what civilisation was. Said the philosopher
with a wave of his hand:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“They have built a lot of houses.”</p>

<p>“But the ships out there are knocking them
down.”</p>

<p>“They have made railways from one town to another.”</p>

<p>“But the black men have torn the railways up.”
(For the native tribes had risen.)</p>

<p>Said Siebenhaar:</p>

<p>“No one can define civilisation. It means doing
things.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Thou art the greatest of men,” replied Siebenhaar,
and his face beamed approbation and love upon
his friend. But to put an unanswerable question to
Siebenhaar was to set him off on his theories.</p>

<p>“First,” he said, “the stomach must be fed.
Two men working together can procure more food
than two men working separately. That is as far as
we have got. Until the two men trust each other we
are not likely to get any further. Until then they
will steal each other’s tools, goods, women, and
squabble over the proceeds of their work and make
the world a hell for the young. When one man
steals or murders it is a crime: when forty million
men steal, murder, rape, burn, destroy, pillage, sack,
oppress, they are making glorious history, a lot of
money, and, if they like to call it so, an Empire.
But Empire and petty thefts are both occasioned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the lamentable distrust of the two men of our postulate.”</p>

<p>“But for Arabella,” said George, “I could wish
I had never left my island.”</p>

<p>News of the war came dribbling in. The island
had been twice captured by the Fatter fleet, and
twice it had been evacuated. The Fatters had suffered
defeat in their home waters but had gained a
victory in the Indian seas. Came news that the island
had again been captured, then the tidings that
the whole of the Fatter fleet and army was to be concentrated
upon Cecilia and the colony of which it
was the capital.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked George.</p>

<p>“Because a new reef of gold has been discovered
up-country.”</p>

<p>The bombardment grew very fierce. From the
mountain above the town ships of war could be seen
coming from all directions, and some of them were
Fattish ships, but not enough as yet to come to grips
with the Fatter fleet.</p>

<p>The inland frontiers were attacked but held,
though with frightful loss of life. Then one night
from the Fatter fleet came a landing party, and Colonel
Sir Gerard Schweinfleisch called a council of
war, and the officers sat from ten o’clock until three
in the morning debating what had best be done.</p>

<p>At half-past one the landing party were only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
mile away. A shell burst in the street as George
was walking to his lodging and three men were killed
in front of him. It was the first time he had seen
such a thing. It froze his blood. He gave a yell
that roused the whole town, ran, was followed
by a crowd of riff-raff seizing weapons as they went,
and rushed down upon the enemy, who had stopped
for a moment to see two dogs fighting in the road.
They were taken by surprise and utterly routed.</p>

<p>There is no more rousing episode in the whole military
history of Fatland. George was for three days
the hero of the Empire. He received by wireless
telegraphy countless offers of marriage, ten proposals
from music-hall engagements, and by cable a demand
for the story of the fight from the noble proprietor
of a Sunday newspaper. It was impossible to persuade
that noble proprietor that there was no extant
photograph of Mr. Samways, and a fortune was
spent in cablegrams in the fruitless attempts to do so.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XV: NAVAL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it turned out the concentration on Cecilia was a
fatal tactical error, directly traceable to the King-Emperor,
who had never left the capital of Fatterland
and had been misled by certain telegrams which
had been wrongly deciphered. The entire Fattish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
navy was collected upon the bombarding fleet and
utterly destroyed it.</p>

<p>George and Siebenhaar watched the engagement
from the mountain above Cecilia. It was almost
humorous to see the huge vessels curtsey to the water
and so disappear. It was astonishing to see the Fattish
admiral surround nine of his own vessels and
cause them also to curtsey and disappear.</p>

<p>“What in hell,” said George, who had by now
learned the nature of an oath, “what in hell is he
doing that for?”</p>

<p>“That,” said Siebenhaar, “is for the benefit of
the armament contractors. A war without loss of
ships is no use to them.”</p>

<p>And suddenly George burst into tears, because he
had thought of all the men on board, and was overcome
with the futility of it all and the feeling that
he was partially to blame for having been born on his
island.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVI: NATIONAL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fattish are an emotional race. They had overcome
the Fatters, and the only outstanding hero of
that war was George. They insisted on seeing
George. They clamoured for him. They sent a
cruiser to fetch him from Cecilia, and the commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of that cruiser was none other than Mr.
Bich, who had won promotion.</p>

<p>His astonishment was no less great than George’s,
but his adventures were less interesting. After the
destruction of the ship he had been saved by a turtle
which had been attracted by his brass buttons and
had allowed him to ride on his back so long as they
lasted. He had had to give it one every twenty minutes,
and had just come to his last when he was seen
and rescued. He had thought himself the only survivor,
and when he heard that Arabella also had been
delivered from the waves there came into his eye a
gleam which George did not like.</p>

<p>The voyage was quite monotonously uneventful
and George was glad when they reached Fatland.
The Mayor, Corporation, and Citizens, also dogs
and children, of the port at which he landed, turned
out to meet him; he was given the freedom of the
borough, and a banquet, and at both ceremony and
meal he was photographed.</p>

<p>In Bondon he was given five public meals in two
days. He was so bewildered by the number of people
who thronged round him that he left all arrangements
in Siebenhaar’s hands, and Siebenhaar liked
the banquets.</p>

<p>He was received by the Emperor-King and decorated,
and the Empress-Queen said: “How do you
do, Mr. Samways?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>He was followed everywhere by enormous crowds,
and outside his lodgings there were always ten policemen
to clear a way for the traffic. His romantic history
had put a polish on his fame: the motherless and
fatherless orphan, all those years alone upon an island;
no woman in Fatland old or young, rich or
poor, but yearned to be a mother to him and make up
to him for all those years. And then the wonderful
story of his acceptance of the Fattish religion, his reception
on those golden sands into the church at the
hands of the good Bishop of Bygn, after the appalling
disaster to the <i>Oyster</i>. All was known, and the
emotional Fattish found it irresistibly moving.
George in all innocence created a religious revival
such as had never been known. The theatres, music-halls,
picture palaces were deserted: no crowds attended
the football matches or the race-meetings, and
when the newspapers had exhausted the Story of
George Samways their circulation dropped to next to
nothing. The situation for certain trades looked
black indeed.</p>

<p>But of all of this George recked nothing. His
one thought was for Arabella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVII: REUNION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Siebenhaar</span> took a malicious delight in the ruin of
the newspaper trade, and pledged George to attend
a mammoth church meeting in Bondon’s greatest hall
of assembly. There were forty bishops on the platform,
and a Duke presided. George entered.
There were tears, cheers, sobs, sighs, groans, conversions;
and hundreds suddenly became conscious of
salvation, swooned away and were carried out.</p>

<p>The Duke spoke for fifty minutes. Mr. Samways
(he said) would now tell the story of his—er—er—“Have
I got to say something?” said George to
Siebenhaar.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” said Siebenhaar, “to look after the
stomach and the rest will look out for itself.”</p>

<p>George advanced toward the front of the platform
and beamed out upon the eager audience.</p>

<p>Arabella let a pin drop and it could be heard all
over the hall.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> Arabella! For a moment George could
not believe his eyes. It was she! He leaped down
from the platform, took her in his arms and covered
her with kisses.</p>

<p>So strong was the hypnotic power of his fame that
there was no male in that huge audience but followed
his example, no female, old or young, rich or poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
but yielded to it. In vain did the bishops protest
and quote from the marriage service of the Fattish
Church; in vain did they go among the audience
and earnestly implore the individual members of it
to desist. They replied that George Samways had
revealed a new religion and that they liked it.</p>

<p>And above the tumult rose the voice of Siebenhaar
saying: —— But what he said is unprintable.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVIII: BETROTHAL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> he escaped from the pandemonium George
never knew, but his first clear recollection after it was
of being borne swiftly through the streets of Bondon
with Arabella in his arms, she weeping and telling
him of the hard and vile usage she had been put to
on the Fatter ship, for the Admiral was a horrid
man. She told him how she had at last been taken
to the Fatterland and there, by her father’s influence—(for
her father also had been marvelously delivered
from an untimely end)—released and sent,
first-class at the expense of the Fatter Government,
home to Fatland, and how she had there resumed her
old life of district visiting and tea parties and diocesan
conferences and rescuing white slaves and had
been content in it until she had seen him, when all her
old love had sprung once more into flame and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
would never, never desert him more. George wept
also and protested that he would never leave her
side.</p>

<p>She took him to her home, and her father, who
had been prevented by indisposition from attending
the meeting, blessed him and made him welcome.</p>

<p>It was very late and George drew Arabella to his
side and said he would send for his things.</p>

<p>“Things!” said the Bishop.</p>

<p>“We love each other,” replied George.</p>

<p>“Do you propose to marry this man?” asked the
Bishop.</p>

<p>Arabella blushed and explained to George that he
must go away until they were married, and the
Bishop revealed the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>“But why?” asked George.</p>

<p>“It is so ordained,” said the Bishop, and George
was exasperated.</p>

<p>“I love Arabella,” he cried. “What more do
you want? And what on earth has it got to do with
you or anybody else? I love Arabella, and my love
has survived shipwreck, starvation, explosion, battle,
murder, and the public festivities of Fatland....”</p>

<p>With extraordinary cynicism the Bishop replied:</p>

<p>“That may be. But it is doubtful if it will survive
marriage; therefore marriage is necessary.”</p>

<p>This illogical argument silenced George. The
Bishop finally gave his consent and the marriage was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
arranged to take place in a month’s time, and the
announcement of the betrothal was sent to the only
remaining morning newspaper.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIX: REACTION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were great rejoicings when peace between
Fatland and Fatterland was signed and ratified, and
the day was set apart for an imposing ceremony at
the Colonial Office, when George’s island was to be
solemnly incorporated in the Empire.</p>

<p>In a little room high up in the huge offices Field-Marshals,
Admirals, and Cabinet Ministers foregathered.
The State Map of the World was produced
and the island was marked on it, and George with
his own hand was to have the privilege of underlining
its name in red ink. It was an awful moment.
George dipped his pen in the ink—(it was the first
time he had ever held a pen in his hand and he had
to be instructed in its use); he dipped his pen in the
ink, held it poised above the map, when the door
opened and a white-faced clerk rushed in with a sheet
of paper as white as his face. This he gave to the
Colonial Secretary, who collapsed. The Lord High
Flunkey took the paper and said:</p>

<p>“Good God!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>George dropped the pen and made a red blot on
the State Map of the World.</p>

<p>The Lord High Flunkey pulled himself together
and said:</p>

<p>“My Lords and Gentlemen, the South Seas
Squadron commissioned to annex the new island reports
that it has moved on and cannot be found.”</p>

<p>“This is a serious matter, Mr. Samways,” said
the senior Admiral.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” answered George, and he
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that when George underlined
the name of his island on the map, the national
flag should be run up on the offices so that the expectant
crowd should know that the Empire had
been enlarged and the war justified. There was an
appalling silence as George left the building. He
slipped into the crowd before he was recognized and
before the awful news had spread.</p>

<p>There was a groan, a hoot, a yell, and the crowd
stormed and raved. Stones flew, and soon there was
not a window in that office left unbroken.</p>

<p>The Government resigned, and with its fall fell
George Samways. He was not the object of any
active hostility. He was simply ignored. It was
as though he had never been. When he called at the
Bishop’s house to see Arabella, the footman stared
through him and said the Bishop would be obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
if he would write. George took the fellow by the
scruff of the neck and laid him on the floor. Then
he ran upstairs to Arabella’s room.</p>

<p>“You!” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes. I love you.”</p>

<p>“We can’t be married now.”</p>

<p>“No. We needn’t wait now. You’re coming
with me.”</p>

<p>He assisted her to pack a small handbag, and with
that they set forth.</p>

<p>At George’s lodgings they found Siebenhaar in
argument with the master of the ship, who had delivered
them and had now come to Bondon to claim
his reward. He had sailed from Cecilia in his own
ship, which was even now at the docks.</p>

<p>“We will sail in her,” said George, “and we will
find my island.”</p>

<p>“Find the island? The whole navy’s looking for
it!”</p>

<p>“It will come to me,” said George.</p>

<p>And Siebenhaar embraced Arabella and congratulated
her on having taken his advice.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XX: HOME</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had a pleasant voyage, saw the sea-serpent
twice, and when they came to the South Seas every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
night George sang those strange melodious chants
that he had made out of <i>Tittiker</i>. One night when
they had been at sea nigh eight months up and down
the Southern Seas and almost into the Antarctic,
George fell into a kind of swoon and said:</p>

<p>“She is coming, she is coming, my mother, my
land.”</p>

<p>And Arabella, fearing for his reason, implored
Siebenhaar to distract him with talk, and the master
of the ship to make for the nearest port. But
George silenced Siebenhaar, and in an unearthly
voice he crooned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cathoire Mor, or the Great—had thirty
sons.</p>

<p>Conn Ceadchadhach, called the Hero of the
Hundred Battles—slain.</p>

<p>Conaire—killed.</p>

<p>Art-Aonfhir, the Melancholy—slain in battle.</p>

<p>Lughaidh, surnamed MacConn—thrust
through the eye with a spear in a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Feargus, surnamed Black-teeth—murdered at
the instigation of his successor.</p>

<p>Cormac-Ulfhada—‘A Prince of the most excellent
wisdom, and kept the most splendid
court that ever was in Bareland’; choked by
the bone of a fish at supper....”</p>
</div>

<p>Near dawn he rose to his feet and stood with outstretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
arms, yelling at the top of his voice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Connor, or Conchabhar—‘died of grief,
being unable to redress the misfortunes of
his country.’</p>

<p>Niall-Caillie—drowned in the river Caillie.</p>

<p>Turgesius—‘expelled the Barish historians,
and burnt their books’; thrown into a lough
and drowned....”</p>
</div>

<p>And Siebenhaar lifted up his eyes in wonder, for
there was such a note of triumph in George’s voice.</p>

<p>The sun was casting up his first rosy glow upon
the sky, and against it, dark blue, almost purple,
stood a tall hill that grew. There was little wind,
but the ship sped forward.</p>

<p>“My beloved! My island!” cried George,
and Arabella fell upon his neck.</p>

<p>As the sun rose above the horizon they slipped
ashore upon the yellow sands, and George’s palm
tree bowed to them and they four, George, Arabella,
Siebenhaar and the master of the ship, joined hands
and danced together.</p>

<p>Then George took Arabella to the little cabin and
he said:</p>

<p>“The house I built for you.”</p>

<p>But Siebenhaar said:</p>

<p>“I am devilish hungry.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I: THE SON OF HIS FATHER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> her love for George never faded, Arabella
could not take kindly to life on the island. She
bore herself cheerfully until she was with child, and
then, when she began to plan careers for her son, she
was oppressed by the absence of opportunity which
that life could afford. She told herself that when
she was dead and Siebenhaar was dead and George
was dead the boy would be left alone with the Captain,
who was only a common man. She had another
two months to go when the Captain disappeared
one night with his ship and a cargo of rubies
and emeralds. The blow was too much for her: the
only means of communication with the world of
Bishops and white slaves was gone; she sank into a
profound melancholy: the boy was born before his
time; and she died.</p>

<p>George flung himself on the sands and wept and
swore he would call the boy Judas, because he had
betrayed him. However, Siebenhaar protested,
saying that, as the boy could not be christened, it was
not right to give him a Biblical name. He said that
he personally should call him Ultimus as he bade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
fair to be the last of his line, unless, as had happened
before, the island should insist on its population
being continued. For that was how, after much
cogitation, the philosopher had come to explain the
previous strange adventure. George was indifferent,
but from hearing Siebenhaar call the boy Ultimus
he also adopted the name, not knowing its sad
significance. Bearing deeply imprinted in his soul
the marks of his unhappy contact with the world,
George forbade all mention of it in his son’s presence.
Never was he to know of the hateful race
who inhabited Fatland, and of the indomitable Fatters
whose admiral had so shamefully treated his
mother. However, Siebenhaar used to talk in his
sleep, and he often slept in the middle of the day.
When he was six years old little Ultimus came to his
father and said:</p>

<p>“What is God? What is an engine? Is the
world round? What is a mother? Who is Siebenhaar’s
father? What is a professor? Why does
Siebenhaar talk in two ways? If you helped me to
be born why can’t I help some one else? Is a Bishop
a kind of man? Did I kill my mother, and how did
I do it if I never saw her? Is this your island?
What is an island? Are there other sorts of land?
Are the stars land? Is the moon land? Is the sun
land? If you are my father, why isn’t Siebenhaar
some one’s father? Are all big men fathers?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
How do they do it? There are two kinds of goats,
why aren’t there two kinds of men? If there are
she-goats, why aren’t there she-men? What is a
ship? Siebenhaar is always talking about ships.
What is money? Are you a King? There is a
King in Fatland. When is a father grand?...”</p>

<p>George gave one despairing look at his son. He
groaned:</p>

<p>“Arabella, my love, my love.”</p>

<p>Then he walked out into the sea and disappeared.
A few hours later his body was washed up on the
shore, and Siebenhaar had to explain to the boy that
his father was dead. Ultimus said:</p>

<p>“He walked out into the sea.”</p>

<p>“To such peace,” replied Siebenhaar solemnly,
“do we all come.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">II: QUESTIONS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the boy’s questions were fatal to his father they
were a delight to Siebenhaar, who had no further
scruple about giving instruction, for, in the hardship
and solitude which had been his fate since his encounter
with George, his philosophy had matured
and he saw that the remaining years of his life might
be spent in the instruction and preparation of a disciple.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>They would sit for hours together on the sands
drawing maps and diagrams for illustration. Siebenhaar
had no knowledge which he did not communicate
to Ultimus, who by the time he was seventeen
was a master of mathematics, German philosophy,
the rudiments of physics, chemistry, geology,
physiology, biology, psychology, botany, meteorology,
astronomy. They made wind and stringed instruments
and played duets composed of what Siebenhaar
could remember of Beethoven. The boy
was a good sculptor and painter, a carpenter, a cabinet-maker,
a mason, a cook, an engineer, a weaver,
a tailor, a cobbler. He could read and write five
languages, was familiar with the geography of the
whole world, and knew the situations of the best
brothels in all the first-class ports. When he began
to have needs which there was no means of satisfying,
Siebenhaar explained them to him:</p>

<p>“You are now reaching that state of man which
reveals the futility of all knowledge, since you are
awakened to desires which no knowledge can satisfy.
Rest assured that in the world your case would be no
better, but rather would be aggravated by opportunity
and failure. You are, at any rate, spared the
tragedy of your father whose love destroyed the
object of his desire and reduced him to a morbid condition
in which your healthy wish for knowledge was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
more than he could bear. It is right to wish for
knowledge, because only through that can we recognise
our ignorance, and see the humour of our position.
If you can see that you can be happy and glad
that you have lived.”</p>

<p>Poor Ultimus tried hard to do so, but he often
retired from their conversations to weep, and Siebenhaar
would find him sitting in the water consoling
himself with music. The unhappy youth became
a prey to boredom and wearied of the arts and
sciences and discussions with which they filled the
day. They had long ago arrived at the conclusion
that there was no God, no ascertainable purpose in
the universe, and nothing in life but the fun or nuisance
of living. He became romantic and plagued
Siebenhaar for stories, love-stories, bawdy experiences,
the tale of his meeting with George, and the
deathless fable of the love of George and Arabella.
From that he came to delight in the idea of war, and
Siebenhaar explained to him how wars came about:
how in the first place men were obsessed by superstitions
about God, each community believing itself to
be specially favoured and inspired by the unseen
powers, and ignoring all the evidence to the contrary,
as poverty, disease, corruption, bad art, inefficiency,
and domestic unhappiness. As a consequence
each community was jealous of every other, and supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
its claims to moral superiority and divine
favour with a great show of force, of armed ships
on the sea and trained men on the land.</p>

<p>To illustrate his remarks Siebenhaar concocted explosives
and Ultimus found such great amusement in
them and was so busy destroying the houses he had
built, the statues he had made, the engines he had
contrived, that the philosopher was forced to change
his theory of war and to see that it has its roots in
boredom.</p>

<p>Thereafter Ultimus was alternately busy with the
arts and sciences and with destroying all his works
when he was bored with them and could not help recognising
their futility. As his explosives upset Siebenhaar’s
nerves and the tranquillity he required for
his contemplation, they made an arrangement that
Ultimus should give notice of his destructive intentions
when he felt them coming on. Then Siebenhaar
would retire to the other side of the island and
leave him to it.</p>

<p>The boy made a careful study of explosives and
experimented with them until he could send huge
palm trees hundreds of feet into the air. It became
his ambition to blow up the mountain. He made
several attempts, but could not succeed. He blew
great holes in it and discovered mines of gold and
diamonds and platinum and various new earths which,
when mixed with his explosive, increased its power.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
But the mountain seemed to be capable of absorbing
any shock. He had just given up his experiments in
despair when Siebenhaar came rushing over in a
great state of excitement to say that the island had
moved a degree and a half.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other incredulously,
not daring to believe in what was thumping in both
their minds. They prepared a new charge, took
their bearings, exploded it, and found that they were
moving at the rate of twenty-three knots an hour,
N.N.W. The next charge they placed so that the
island moved W.N.W.</p>

<p>They could then navigate and go whither they
pleased. They embraced, danced, killed a goat, and
drank heavily to celebrate their triumph.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">III: CIVILISATION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> north point of the island was a rocky headland,
a precipice hundreds of feet above the sea-level. Beyond
it jutted three jagged rocks. One morning
Siebenhaar found on one of these rocks the hull of a
vessel, and when he looked closer he saw a man sitting
disconsolate upon it. He fetched Ultimus, who
threw stones to attract the man’s attention. It was
impossible to make him hear. They gesticulated to
tell him to swim to his right, and at last he caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
their meaning, stripped and plunged into the sea.
They had already stopped the island, which was now
making only a gentle way, so that there was no danger
of his being run down.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the shore the man was
already sitting on the sands drying himself and eating
a cocoa-nut. He was above middle age, and
had a little fat belly and long thin legs. Siebenhaar
addressed him in Fattish, and the man said he was a
Rear-Admiral in the Fattish Navy and would like to
know what in hell they meant by ruining his battle
in which he had got the Fatters fairly on the run.</p>

<p>“Battle?” said Siebenhaar.</p>

<p>“Yes. Four cruisers, six destroyers, and torpedo
craft. All gone on the rocks. The most amazing
thing in all my long experience. Not a sign of
a rock on the chart. You must have got the Fatters
first, for their firing suddenly ceased. Who are
you? What are you?”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar told him it was Samways Island.</p>

<p>The man’s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>“I spent the best part of three years after that,”
he said. “I originally annexed it for the Empire.”</p>

<p>“Not,” cried Siebenhaar. “<i>Not</i> Mr. Bich?”</p>

<p>“Bich is my name.”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar disclosed his identity and Rear-Admiral
Bich covered his amazement and emotion with
a volley of expletives. He asked after George, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
when he was told that both he and Arabella were
dead he could not check his tears.</p>

<p>He shook Ultimus warmly by the hand and said
he was the very spit of his father, with a strong look
of his mother. Then he added: “I must not forget
my duty as an officer, and, as a matter of form,
I claim the island once more for the Empire.”</p>

<p>“If you do,” said Ultimus quietly, “I shall blow
you in pieces. I know how the Fattish Empire
treated my father, and, but for your kindly thoughts
of my mother, I would send you to join the ships
which I am only too happy to have destroyed if such
a disaster can cause any genuine commotion in Bondon.
I will further caution you to be careful what
you say, as I am unaccustomed to society other than
that of the wise Siebenhaar, and already feel my soul
filled with dislike and contempt for you. This island
is my island by inheritance, it is moving by my will
and I shall allow you to stay on it just as long as you
are useful to me.”</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Bich saw the strength of Ultimus’
position and was silent until Siebenhaar asked him
for news of civilisation, when he expressed surprise
that they had not heard of the war.</p>

<p>“War?” said Siebenhaar. “Are they still at
that game? Why, we were told that the Fattero-Fattish
war was to be the last.”</p>

<p>“That,” replied the Admiral, “was a mere skirmish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
There are six or seven nations at war with
Fatterland.”</p>

<p>“Alas! my poor country!” cried the philosopher.
“I knew how it would be. Their infernal greed
and conceit, their confusion of mind, their slothfulness,
their desire for discipline, their liking for monuments
and display, their want of tact, all these defects
needed but success for them to grow into active
vice and plunge them into disaster. To any nation
a period of successful peace is fatal. The employment
of commercial cunning unredeemed by any
other exercise of the mind is, after a time, unutterably
boring, and the most obvious relief from it is
found in the ideal of a nation in arms. Now that
is a barren ideal. To train men for so stupid and
brutal a trade as the soldier’s is to increase the already
excessive amount of stupidity and brutality in
the world. To maintain large bodies of stupid and
brutal men in arms is in the end to be forced to find
an excuse for using them. Human nature, I fear, is
incurably pugnacious and destructive. I have had
to amend many of my more optimistic opinions concerning
the human race since I have had the privilege
of watching the development of our young friend
yonder. He is normal, healthy and intelligent, and
acquainted with all the resources of civilisation,
physical and mental. There is hardly a practical
discovery of modern science that I have not placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
at his disposal for his use and amusement, but these
do not satisfy him. He is not exposed to the nervous
pressure to which in our crowded modern states I
used to ascribe outbreaks of hostility. No. In the
absence of an enemy he must declare war upon his
own handiwork, upon the elements, upon the very
earth itself.”</p>

<p>“Before you go any further,” said the Rear-Admiral,
“I should like something to eat, and I should
like to explain that on our side in the war is the right.
The Fatters have behaved like savages. They have
burned cities, murdered old men and children, raped
women and committed every outrage.”</p>

<p>“I have seen something of warfare myself,” said
Siebenhaar. “It is a bestial occupation. When a
man has become accustomed to slaughter by license,
what is there to make him stop at minor offences such
as theft, rape, and wounding? Soldiers who are unchaste
in peace do not become chaste when war is declared.
In a friendly country the women consent.
In a hostile country some of them protest, generally
because they are panic-stricken and in terror of
worse happening to them.”</p>

<p>“This war,” said the Rear-Admiral, “is holy.”</p>

<p>“I am a Fatter,” replied Siebenhaar, “and the
Fatters have been taught for generations that all
war is holy and sanctifies all that is done in its
name.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“We,” said the Fattishman, “fight like gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“And,” retorted the philosopher, “like gentlemen
you burn and rape and pillage.”</p>

<p>“Your conversation,” said Ultimus, “has interested
me extremely. I am filled with a burning desire
to see civilisation, war, soldiers, and, above all,
women. We will go to the centre of civilisation,
and if I do not like it I shall blow it in pieces.”</p>

<p>“Two can play at that game,” said Bich. “We
have explosives too.”</p>

<p>For answer, Ultimus reached out and pressed two
wires together. There was a rumble, a crash, a
thud, and hundreds of tons of rock were torn away
from the side of the mountain and hurled into the air
to fall, miles away, into the sea.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IV: WAR AND WOMEN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a sailor, Charles Bich, though middle-aged, liked
nothing better than to talk about women. He was
sentimental about them, but at the same time sensually
appreciative of their beauty. To such an extent
did he inflame the young man’s imagination that Siebenhaar
had to protest.</p>

<p>“It is a shame,” he cried, “that the son of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
father should be polluted with the obsessions of civilised
men.”</p>

<p>With the air of leaving no more to be said, Ultimus
remarked:</p>

<p>“I like them.”</p>

<p>“So do all unintelligent men,” replied Siebenhaar,
“and they are driven mad by them and hope against
hope for the day when all restraint will be removed.
This is another potent factor in the production of
war. Women are not to the same degree subject to
these terrible obsessions, but they do regret their
limited opportunities in the organised society of
peace. Further, in times of war they like to think
that men are fighting for them, and they love to be
regaled with stories of violence and outrage, especially
those who have been entirely chaste, and have
no hope of anything else.”</p>

<p>The Rear-Admiral blushed.</p>

<p>“When we fight,” he said, “we fight for our
country, our King, our Empire, for the all-red map
of the world.”</p>

<p>“These,” replied Siebenhaar, “are words. Country,
King, Empire, are protective ideas. What you
love and what you defend is your mode of living,
which you have adopted partly because you have a
prejudice in favour of it, partly because you like it
better than any other you can conceive. Your living
consists in eating, drinking, consorting with women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and rearing any family you may produce. Everything
else is introduced merely to disguise any unpleasantness
there may be in the exercise of those
functions. For the most part they are lies, illusions,
hallucinations, obsessions, which you find convenient
to cloak your unimportance. As a naval officer you
justify the absurd occupation by which you procure
your livelihood. My young friend here is under no
such painful necessity and I wish him to be spared
all mental confusion.”</p>

<p>“Personally,” interrupted Ultimus, “I do not
wish to be influenced by either of you. You, sir,”
addressing Siebenhaar, “have given me all the
knowledge and wisdom you have stored up in your
adventurous life, and you, sir, have out of your life
of duty, given me a new interest in the two things,
war and women, which have hitherto been denied me.
I am much obliged to you, and, if you don’t mind we
will continue the erection of the wireless installation
we began yesterday, because I am anxious to establish
communication with the world as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Ultimus and Bich retired to the top of the mountain
leaving Siebenhaar sadly tracing on the sands a
rough caricature of a woman. So horrible was it to
him that he could not finish it and obliterated it with
his foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">V: WIRELESS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> day brought messages from the world. The
Fattish had made a glorious retreat of sixty miles.
The Waltzians were offering a glorious resistance to
the Grossians. With the help of God the Fatters
had gloriously evacuated their trenches on the west,
and heroically withdrawn from a river on the east.
With assistance from above the Fattish navy had
swept the Fatter flag from the seven seas. The
Bilgians had been nobly extinguished, though their
flag was still flying and their King ruled over a
flooded country. Hundreds of thousands of men
were killed, wounded, and lost. From country to
country General congratulated General, Admirals
sent their applause to Field-Marshals, Statesmen
exchanged bravos, and monarchs thanked each other
and God for timely assistance.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Bich said: “Isn’t it glorious—glorious?”</p>

<p>“At present,” replied Ultimus, “I am so confused
that I can make nothing of it. Why are they all so
pleased with themselves? Do they like to think of
thousands of men dying?”</p>

<p>“They have died for their country. They are
heroes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that. I cannot imagine myself going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
out of my way to die for my island, and Fatland is
also an island.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Rear-Admiral. “But there are
no women on your island, no little ones, no homes.”</p>

<p>“There is Siebenhaar who has been father and
mother to me, master and instructor.”</p>

<p>“Well! Suppose you saw men designing to murder
Siebenhaar, would you not raise a hand to defend
him?”</p>

<p>“Not if I saw there was not the remotest chance
of saving him. But that is nonsense. No one
would want to murder Siebenhaar.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. There are times
when he is so exasperating that I hardly dare answer
for myself.”</p>

<p>“That is absurd,” replied Ultimus. “You know
that I should destroy you at once if you did anything
to Siebenhaar. The case might be different if you
were in such a position that there would be consequences.
But why deal with hypothesis when you
are confronted with facts?”</p>

<p>The simple sailor was no hand at an argument,
and just at that moment there came the news of the
loss of a Fattish fleet after an encounter with the
Fatters, with an account of the heroic death of the
Commander, Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Bich.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the island was not yet in a position
to transmit messages and the unhappy Bich had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
rest inactive, crushed with the burden of the news of
his own death and his inability to contradict it.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Ultimus, “you <i>have</i> died for your
country, you are a hero, and you do not like it at all.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VI: BICH IS OBSTINATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> point was argued for many days. Bich
would not withdraw from his assertion that it was
glorious to die for his country, but at the same time
he could not disguise his distress at having done so.</p>

<p>“If I had died,” he said, “it would have been
glorious.”</p>

<p>“Only in the eyes of your countrymen,” said Siebenhaar.
“You already have that, and if you had
died you would not have known anything about it.”</p>

<p>“There is a heaven above,” cried Bich.</p>

<p>“Which you could never have entered. Has not
Heaven enjoined you not to kill and not to resist
evil?”</p>

<p>“In the service of my country!”</p>

<p>“What does heaven know of your country?
Heaven is eternal. Its laws are for eternity. Your
country, your Empire are mere temporary arrangements
for the convenience of a few millions of men
and women who wish to profit by the labours of people
less fortunate than themselves. You are therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
contending that it is glorious to die for a
man’s material advantage, or, in other words, for political
and financial vested interests.”</p>

<p>“I am prepared at any moment to die for my
country.”</p>

<p>“You <i>have</i> died.”</p>

<p>“I have not.”</p>

<p>“You have died and been given the glory attaching
to such death.”</p>

<p>“That is what I cannot bear.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Ultimus, “I will give you a root
which will procure you a perfectly painless death. I
see that you do not mind dying for your country so
long as you do not know about it.”</p>

<p>“And that,” put in Siebenhaar, “is where he is
consistent. He is like all the men of his time and
condition; he does not mind living, in fact he quite
likes it, so long as he knows nothing about it and is
not called upon to realise what he is doing. When
he is faced with the consequences of such insensibility
he is so appalled that he welcomes the idea of death,
if he can find some excuse for it. Therefore he has
invented a myth called his country and proposes to
die for that. According to his prejudices it is cowardly
to draw a fire-arm upon himself, but it is right
and brave to place himself in the line of some one
else’s fire. Such a condition of imbecility is extremely
infectious. It sweeps through crowds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
men like a disease through cattle. But, as men are
indomitably hopeful, they do not destroy each other,
as you, Ultimus, might suppose. No, they wait until
they can discover another crowd of men in the same
lamentable condition, and fall upon them in the hope
of a victory which shall restore their self-conceit and
once more blind them to the appalling consequences
of their own ill-doing. And here, at last, we do
touch upon one of the prime causes of war. Superficially
it looks as though the immediate cause was this,
that the governors of States make such a mess of the
affairs with which they are entrusted and reduce their
people to so lamentable a condition that they must
seek war as an outlet, and to give the male populace
as soldiers the food which they have made it impossible
for them to earn as workers. There is also the
consideration that a large proportion of the male
populace will be removed from all possibility of
making trouble. That is an interesting but a superficial
view which attaches more blame to the rich
than they deserve. No. A more profound analysis
gives us the result I have previously indicated,
that wars are invariably due to moral epidemics.
And, since the human race will always be subject to
them, there will always be war.”</p>

<p>Ultimus had withdrawn at the beginning of the
discussion. Having no knowledge of men in herds,
he could not follow the line of Siebenhaar’s argument.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
He returned now to say that he had obliterated
another battle. On this the Rear-Admiral was
excited and wished to know what ships he had seen
and what flag they were flying.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied Ultimus, “but there
were nine ships attacking three and that struck me
as so unfair that I decided to make an end of it.”</p>

<p>“But they may have been Fattish ships! Have
you no regard for human life?”</p>

<p>Said Ultimus:</p>

<p>“There was no sign of anything human. They
looked like flies on the water. When I see three
scorpions attacking a smaller insect I always kill the
scorpions for their cowardice and the insect for having
called down their anger upon itself.”</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Bich drew himself up to his full
height and said:</p>

<p>“As a Christian I protest. As an officer and a
gentleman I must ask you to put me ashore at the
first opportunity. They may be Fattish ships which
you have destroyed. My King and country need
me.”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” interposed Siebenhaar, “your
King and country are probably doing very well without
you. They have an immense geographical advantage
which only the blind jealousy of the Fatters
makes it impossible for them to admit. You are already
a hero; poems have in all probability been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
written to your memory. You had better stay with
us. It will be much more amusing to see what effect
Ultimus has on civilisation than to plunge back
into the fever which has seized it.”</p>

<p>The Rear-Admiral looked scornful and very proud
and said:</p>

<p>“Herr Siebenhaar, on our previous acquaintance
only the protection of the late heroic Mr. Samways
prevented me from denouncing you as a Fatter spy.
I have not forgotten.”</p>

<p>“What,” asked Ultimus, “is a spy?”</p>

<p>“Spies,” replied Siebenhaar, “are corrupt and
useless people who are sent out to frighten a hostile
nation by making them think that the enemy knows
more about them than they do themselves. They
are only used when the desire for war is very strong.
They exercise a paralysing effect upon the civil population
and deliver them up to the guidance of their
own military authorities. They are like microbes
which carry the war fever from one country to another.
I regret that Sir Charles should have so
small an opinion of my intelligence as to think that
my country would make so trivial a use of me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stand all this talk,” muttered the Rear-Admiral,
and he went away and all night long paced
up and down the sands on the other side of the island,
imagining that he was once more serving his
King and country on his own quarter-deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VII: PLANS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> secret the indomitable servant of his country
made himself a boat, a coracle of palm branches and
mud, and when, a week later, they came in sight of
land and Ultimus put in close to have a good look at
it and the little white city built by the mouth of a
river, he put off in it without so much as saying good-bye
or thank you for the hospitality he had received.</p>

<p>“He will come back,” said Siebenhaar; “he will
come and try to annex the island. No Fattish officer
can resist an island and the Fattish have been known
to waste thousands of lives in order to add a bare
rock or a pestilential swamp to their Empire. It is
an amiable lunacy which my unhappy race, who cannot
appreciate their geographical disadvantage, are
trying to emulate. What is the news of the war
to-day?”</p>

<p>“The official reports all agree in saying that there
is no further development. Every capable man in
every country is now bearing arms. All other activity
is at a standstill. Stern measures have had to be
taken by the various governments to stop the emigration
of pregnant women to the peaceful countries
on the other side of the world.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Siebenhaar, “I thought that would
happen, I thought the women would revolt as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
as war ceased to be an excitement and became a
trade.”</p>

<p>“Some of the Governments,” added Ultimus,
“are paying women over forty-five years of age
to go.”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar chuckled.</p>

<p>“It is time we interfered, Ultimus. When they
lose their sense of humour so far as that, it is time
for action. We will go to Fatland. Where are
we now?”</p>

<p>“Off the coast of Africa.”</p>

<p>“We will lie out to sea until we have prepared the
island against all dangers. First of all we will blow
up the harbour. Then we will mine the shores all
round. We will prepare the rocks on the tops of the
mountains for missiles and we will lay in a great
stock of your new transmissible explosive. We will
then block the mouth of the great Fattish river, and
we shall see what we shall see. An intelligent use of
explosives should be able to counteract and if necessary
to crush the fatuous use of them that is now
being made. We will try persuasion, threats, and
violence in that order to stop the war, and if then we
cannot succeed we will abandon the human race altogether
and return to our own Southern Seas.”</p>

<p>“You forget,” expostulated Ultimus, “that I was
drawn here out of curiosity as to something else besides
the war, and that is, woman.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“A man,” said Siebenhaar, “bears a grudge
against woman for his birth; he is a fool to burden
himself with others against her.”</p>

<p>“As I imagine them,” replied the young man wistfully,
“they are beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Lord, Lord,” cried Siebenhaar, “if only a young
man would be content with his imaginings.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VIII: IN FATTISH WATERS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> island moved proudly up the Fattish channel,
until they came within sight of the land on either side
of it. Here was drawn up a great array of ships
like those which had been destroyed in the Southern
Seas. On the foremost of the ships were hoisted a
number of little flags which Siebenhaar interpreted
as saying:</p>

<p>“Good morning. Welcome home.”</p>

<p>Now, the fragmentary message recorded by the
wireless gave the clue to the purport of this signal.
There had been a great rally of the Fattish Empire,
one colony had sent sacks of flour, another black currants,
another black men, another brown sugar; all
came to the aid of the motherland in her need, all
forgot their grievances and vowed that they never
would be slaves. In the face of such a demonstration
no doubt as to whether the Fattish empire really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
existed could survive. Men who would not admit
black, brown, or yellow men to their clubs welcomed
them to their trenches. Such unity, such loyalty,
such brotherhood, must lead to victory. But victory
was slow in coming and it was becoming difficult to
maintain interest in the war, when, suddenly, there
burst upon the Fattish public the news that the lost
island was responding to the call and even now coming
to place its unique powers of motion at the service
of the Emperor-King. The miraculous had happened.
Once more it was obvious that the right was
on the Fattish side. Once more the streets of Bondon
were thronged as on the eve of the declaration
of war. The map of the world with the red blot
made by George Samways was taken down and
copies of it were sold for the Imperial relief fund.
It was supposed that George Samways, the only hero
of the last war, was on the island and had induced it
to return to the fold. His downfall was forgotten,
his heroism remembered.</p>

<p>Ultimus stopped the island and entered into communication
by wireless with the Fattish fleet.</p>

<p>“Is that Samways Island?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is George Samways aboard?”</p>

<p>“No. His son and his friend, Siebenhaar.”</p>

<p>“What nationality is Siebenhaar?”</p>

<p>“Fatter.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“He must be taken prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. He is an ex-engineer, now a philosopher.”</p>

<p>“Fatter philosophers are writing the most scurrilous
abuse of the Fattish.”</p>

<p>“Siebenhaar has been for the last twenty years on
the island.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to change his name before landing, or
he will have to register.”</p>

<p>“We have no intention of landing.”</p>

<p>“We did not get your last message correctly.”</p>

<p>“We have no intention of landing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t understand. May we send a deputation?”</p>

<p>Ultimus replied:</p>

<p>“I will receive one Cabinet Minister and the
most beautiful woman in Fatland. I shall be in the
mouth of the river by two o’clock. You had better
move your ships and be very careful of the backwash.
I understand that the shores of the channel are
strewn with wrecks.”</p>

<p>Frantic messages then passed between the ships
and the Admiralty in Bondon. It would be extremely
awkward to have the island in the river,
blocking the channels to the port, but the public were
thinking of nothing but the island, and, in default of
George Samways, were quite prepared to take his
son to be their darling. There must not be a hint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
anywhere of the possibility of the island’s being,
after all, disloyal. The Fattish had been very reticent
about their relations with God, whereas the Fatters
had claimed him as their ally. The Fattish had
been favored with miracles, even as the Children of
Israel. It was decided to retain the miracle in the
face of all risks and Mr. Samways was promised that
a Cabinet Minister accompanied by the most beautiful
woman in Fatland should call at four o’clock on
the following day.</p>

<p>The fleet turned and steamed away out of sight.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IX: AN AFTERNOON CALL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> acknowledged most beautiful woman in Fatland
was none other than Arabella’s sister. She was
fifty-three, but had managed to preserve her reputation
by the discreet publication of her connection with
illustrious men. She had one rival for the honour of
the visit to the island, a lovely creature, a brilliant
singer of popular ballads, who, during the crisis, had
carried all before her and swept hundreds of young
men into the army with her famous ditty: “Won’t
I kiss you when you come back home?” However,
her claims were disposed of by Arabella’s sister
astutely pointing out that she was the aunt of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
young man on the island, and therefore, if necessary,
could be alone with him in perfect propriety.</p>

<p>In a motor launch she came out with the Lord
High Chief of the Admiralty in full-dress uniform.</p>

<p>No sooner did she set eyes on Ultimus than she
burst into tears and cried that he was the living image
of Arabella. She kissed him and he drew back
outraged and cried:</p>

<p>“Don’t do that again.”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar explained:</p>

<p>“Your nephew, madam, has never seen a woman
before and is naturally alarmed. Your voice must
sound strangely to his ears and your costume, if you
will forgive me, leaves room for considerable doubt
as to the normality of your anatomy. I think it
would be as well if you made no attempt to reassure
him, but allowed him to look at you and to grow accustomed
to you while I engage your companion in
conversation.”</p>

<p>With that he turned to the Lord High Chief and
said:</p>

<p>“You can imagine that I am astounded to return
after a long absence to find civilisation plunged once
more in the barbarism of war. Surely no single one
of the combatants has anything to gain by it.”</p>

<p>“The war, sir, was not of our seeking.”</p>

<p>“But you were prepared for it?”</p>

<p>“By God we were. I had seen to that.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Then you were prepared to join issue in any
quarrel that might be sought?”</p>

<p>“We pledged our word to the Grossians and the
Bilgians. Besides, sir, apart from all that, the Fatters
are jealous of our Empire, and they have deliberately
plotted for years to oust us commercially and
politically. They want us wiped off the map. But
when it comes to wiping——”</p>

<p>“Does it ever come to that?” asked Siebenhaar.
“Is Athens dead while Plato lives? Is Rome forgotten
while Virgil and Lucretius live in the minds of
men? Was there ever more in Spain than lives in
Cervantes?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said the Lord High
Chief; “but the Fatters want to dominate the
world.”</p>

<p>“So did Alexander: so did Napoleon: but they
wrought their own ruin.”</p>

<p>“This is too deep for me,” replied the politician.
“I want something that the newspapers can get hold
of. I want to know what you are up to, how you
found the island, how it came to move again, and, if
it isn’t a miracle of loyalty, what is it? Also I want
to know what your intentions are, because if you are
not here to support us we shall have to place you
both under arrest,—er—that is, after you have
moved the island out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p>Ultimus took Siebenhaar aside and said: “I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
to go away. I have been looking at the woman, and
I think she is horrible.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">X: THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lord High Chief towards the end of the interview
adopted a peremptory tone and ordered the
island to be taken through the enemy’s minefield and
then to blockade the enemy’s fleet. The island was
to be called H.M.S. Samways, to be manned with the
crew of a first-class battleship and commanded by a
senior admiral. Ultimus refused point-blank. He
owed nothing to Fatland, and was not going to have
his island or his inventions used in a cause which he
as yet did not understand. The Lord High Chief
stormed and blustered until Siebenhaar told him the
truth about Bich’s battle and the nature of the invention
of which Ultimus had spoken. The Lord
High Chief went pale and muttered that he should
have thought his country’s cause good enough for any
man. However, since they were so obstinate, he invited
the islanders ashore and undertook to satisfy
their curiosity with regard to the war, or the events
which immediately preceded it. Arabella’s sister
proposed that they should stay in her house, but her
invitation was refused.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>No sooner had the visitors put off in the launch
than Ultimus moved the island further up the river
until all channels were blocked and no ship could get
either in or out.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Ultimus, “they will treat me with
respect, and will not rest content until they have
satisfied me and persuaded me to move the island
once more.”</p>

<p>The effect he desired was produced. They were
taken up to Bondon in one of the Royal motor-cars,
and a whole floor in one of the most expensive hotels
was placed at their disposal. For the first time in
his life Ultimus slept in a bed and was so hot that he
could not bear it. He rang the bell in the middle of
the night and a little chambermaid appeared.</p>

<p>“Take that thing away,” said Ultimus.</p>

<p>The little chambermaid stared at him.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it. I don’t like it,” he said, glowering
at the girl’s face. It was like a flower, like a
star; it was beautiful. Ultimus could not take his
eyes off it. Her eyes smiled back at his amazed
curiosity. He stood and reeled and said:</p>

<p>“I love you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the little chambermaid.</p>

<p>“My father said the Fattish were false. I asked
them to send me the most beautiful woman in the
land and they sent me a hideous old creature.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Ah! Why did they not send you? We could
have gone away at once, away, away, where there
are no old women, no battleships, no beds.”</p>

<p>The little chambermaid by this time was fascinated,
and she stayed with Ultimus all night, while
he talked and told her how he had desired to see a
woman and was now satisfied and never wished to
see another, and how when he had seen the war he
and she would retire to the island.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” said the little chambermaid. “And
shall I be a Queen? And won’t the Fatters ever
be able to get near the island? They all say the
Fatters do awful things to women.”</p>

<p>Ultimus took her to his breast and they were
joined in the mystical union of a kiss; and for many
hours no word passed between them.</p>

<p>In the morning they were disturbed by Siebenhaar,
who came in unsuspectingly, saw what had happened
and withdrew discreetly, gave orders to the
management that Mr. Samways was not to be disturbed,
and went out to see Bondon in war-time.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XI: HIGH POLITICS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> streets were full of young men in uniform. In
the parks were young men without uniform being
drilled. Except for policemen, hall-porters, street-scavengers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the town was empty, and when Siebenhaar
asked a policeman why it was so, he was informed
that everybody had gone to look at the island.</p>

<p>Said the constable: “There was nothing like it
since I was a boy, when the war began.”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar was taken aback.</p>

<p>“How long?” he said.</p>

<p>“Well! It’ll be a matter of fifteen years now,
though it’s difficult to remember. It goes on.
Things get quiet in the winter. Then it begins again
with the fine weather, with a new list of Fatter atrocities.
Then there’s a new promise from the Emperor
of Grossia; then we have another rally of the
Empire and things become livelier.”</p>

<p>“I am astonished,” said Siebenhaar, “that a great
free nation like the Fattish should tolerate such a
state of affairs.”</p>

<p>“Bless you,” said the policeman, “I’ve forgotten
what peace was like. There’s a few old gentlemen
hold meetings to talk about it, but we’re used to it
by now. I remember there used to be scares about
our being invaded, but they soon came to an end.
We all take our spell at the fighting, and, if we come
home, settle down to work of one sort or another.
There’s no doubt about it, the Fatters would make
a nasty mess of things if we didn’t keep them bottled
up.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Siebenhaar protested: “Surely you yourselves
are making a nasty mess of things?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” replied the policeman. “That’s over
the water. You soon forget about it when you get
back home. It would be funny, sir, if that there
island were to put a stop to the war. We’d hardly
know what to do with our young men.”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar’s blood boiled. A great nation, with
a tradition of freedom, could acquiesce in such arrest
of its life, such wanton sacrifice of its youth!</p>

<p>He visited the Lord High Chief and found him
just out of his bed in a suit of blue silk pajamas.
Breakfast was laid before him and he offered Siebenhaar
coffee. It was refused.</p>

<p>“I am come, sir, to tell you that the island will
not be used to assist you. It will be used to stop the
war.”</p>

<p>“Stop the——?”</p>

<p>“As I say.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, sir. The war cannot be stopped
until all parties to it agree to our terms of settlement.
It is a matter of high politics, which it takes
an expert to understand. We have the matter well
in hand. The country was told at the beginning that
it was to be a long war. It will be finished when our
terms are agreed upon and not before.”</p>

<p>“And those terms are——?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“They are known to my colleagues and myself.
When the settlement is concluded they will be laid
before the country.”</p>

<p>“And have you, sir, during the last fifteen years
ever risked your life on land or sea? Have you suffered
in pocket or in health? Have you been deprived
of even a luxury?”</p>

<p>“For fifteen years I have been the hardest worked
man in the country. I have practically lived in this
office. When things were going badly with us I
made speeches up and down the country.”</p>

<p>“Asking young men to give their lives and thank
God for the privilege of dying before they had tasted
the full sweetness of life.”</p>

<p>“It is their country’s life against theirs.”</p>

<p>“You say so.”</p>

<p>“The Fatters will make an end of us if they
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Have you made an end of the Fatters?”</p>

<p>“No. But we will before we have done.”</p>

<p>“Are the Fatter women all stricken with barrenness?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of.”</p>

<p>“Then you cannot make an end of the race.”</p>

<p>“We can smash their Empire.”</p>

<p>“A word. Can you smash a word? You seem
to me, sir, to talk and act as though a nation were an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
abstraction instead of a collection of human beings,
bound together by language, manners, and religion.”</p>

<p>“It is a matter of high politics.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me, sir, that war is the logical outcome
of your view of national life, and that a nation
without a war is not a nation. I should imagine that a
war greatly facilitates the task of government. The
rich can always be trusted to look after themselves,
but the poor are rendered impotent. I cannot raise
a hand to support either such a view or such a condition.
You have attained the ideal of high politics,
the sacrifice of domestic affairs to international relations.
I congratulate you. I decline all further
hospitality at your hands. My young friend has already
realized one of his ambitions. I shall request
the Emperor of Fatterland to satisfy the other.
We shall go to Fatterland to-morrow and see the
war which you have been able to confine to other
countries.”</p>

<p>“Herr Siebenhaar,” shouted the Lord High
Chief, “you shall do no such thing. The public has
taken the island to its heart. You will consider
yourself under arrest.”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar smiled sweetly:</p>

<p>“I have seen the Fattish public take Mr. George
Samways to its heart and I have seen it reject him.
I do not think you will arrest me, for, before leaving
the island we arranged an explosion to take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
two days from now in case of our non-return. Such
an explosion would project thousands of tons of rock
over your city.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XII: THE PUBLIC</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ultimus</span> refused to be separated from the lady
of his choice, and when Siebenhaar said he must return
to the island the little chambermaid declared
her willingness to go if she could be married first.</p>

<p>“You need not worry about that,” grumbled Siebenhaar.
“There will be no other women on the
island, no one to care whether you are married or no,
no one to bully you if you have dispensed with the
ceremony, and Ultimus has no relations except his
aunt, who will never forgive him for his frankness.
I warn you that on our island you will find none of
the excitements of the great hotel, neither the advantages
of society nor its disadvantages.”</p>

<p>“I will come,” said the little chambermaid, “if
you will let me tell my mother that I am married.
It would kill her if she thought I was not.”</p>

<p>“A lie more or less in a community is no great
matter, since its existence depends upon lies,” said
Siebenhaar.</p>

<p>So the chambermaid wrote to her mother, packed
her belongings in her tin box, and with Siebenhaar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and Ultimus was driven in the royal motor-car to the
docks. The last few miles they drove through
enormous cheering crowds, men, women, and children,
singing as they went.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Won’t I kiss you when you come back home,</div>
<div class="indent3">My soldier boy!</div>
<div class="verse">For my heart is with you as you cross the foam,</div>
<div class="indent3">My soldier boy!</div>
<div class="indent">You are big and you are brave,</div>
<div class="indent">From the Huns our homes to save,</div>
<div class="indent">Or to find a hero’s grave.</div>
<div class="verse">Won’t I kiss you when you come back home!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>A motor launch took them swiftly out to the island
and there Ultimus was proud to show the little
house he had built and the gardens he had made.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they went up to the top of the
mountain, where an amazing sight met their eyes.
Through the smoke loomed the towers and domes
and chimneys of the great city, and on the banks of
the river for miles stretched the crowds of people,
and others came along the roads, pouring in on foot,
in carts, and wagons. Ultimus was seized with nausea,
which soon gave place to rage and he stamped
his foot on the ground and cried:</p>

<p>“There are too many of them. Let me destroy
them.”</p>

<p>But Siebenhaar wept and said:</p>

<p>“Rather destroy those heartless men who herd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
them like cattle and rob them of the fruits of their
labour and bid them believe in a God whom they
deny, a national idea which they can maintain only
by the destruction of life and the ruin of the nation.
Destroy those who sacrifice beauty to their pleasures,
and love to their obstinate pride. See, the city must
be empty now, destroy it.”</p>

<p>Ultimus moved his hand and in one moment the
domes, towers and chimneys of the city disappeared.
The island moved and the crowd, seeing that which
they had come to see, clapped their hands and
shouted until the island disappeared.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIII: THE EMPEROR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a few hours they were off the coast of Fatterland,
and had blocked up the harbour where the Fatter
fleet lay in hiding from the overwhelming superiority
of the Fattish. The Emperor himself, who had already
heard of the destruction of Bondon, came out
to greet them. He had information as to Siebenhaar’s
previous career and he decorated him at sight
with a Silver Eagle. To Ultimus he handed an
Iron Cross.</p>

<p>The Emperor was dressed in a large brass helmet,
a white suit with a steel cuirass, and enormous shining
boots. He was a little man and very pompous.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“God,” he said, “has blessed you.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Siebenhaar.</p>

<p>“God,” said the Emperor, “has preserved the
Fatterland, through me.”</p>

<p>“On this island,” retorted Siebenhaar, “we are
accustomed to talk sense. There would have been
no need for God or anybody else to defend Fatterland
if you had not so wantonly destroyed peaceful
relations with other countries.”</p>

<p>The Emperor removed his helmet.</p>

<p>“What a relief!” he said. “No one has ever
talked sensibly to me before. You don’t know how
sick I am of being an Emperor with everybody assuming
that I don’t wish to think of anything but my
own dignity. I am not allowed to think or talk of
anything else.”</p>

<p>“Has it ever occurred to you,” asked Siebenhaar,
“that a dignity which requires over a million soldiers
to maintain it is hardly worth it? Have you ever
thought that the million soldiers are maintained not
for your dignity, but because their housing, their
feeding, their equipment are all exceedingly profitable
to a few men?”</p>

<p>“I have often thought that,” replied the Emperor,
“but I have never found a soul willing to discuss it
with me. When I meet other Emperors the same
dreadful thought haunts all of us, but none of us
dare speak of it, for we are watched night and day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and what we are to say to each other is written by
young men in the Government Offices.”</p>

<p>The Emperor began to cry.</p>

<p>“Four million men have been killed since the war
began, and everybody says it is my fault. I didn’t
make the war, I didn’t, indeed I didn’t. It was not
in my power to make war, any more than it is in my
power to stop it. Horrible things have been done
by the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Poor wretches!” said Siebenhaar. “How can
they be anything but bestial, deprived as they are of
all that makes life sweet?”</p>

<p>“How, indeed?” asked the Emperor. “Thousands
have died of dysentery, or cholera, and enteric
and typhoid. Hundreds of thousands more of
starvation and exposure. It is impossible, I tell you,
impossible to prevent organisation breaking down.
Contractors!” He shook his fists. “Ah! There
is nothing contractors will not do, from sending bad
food to insisting on being paid for food they have
never sent. Ah! the villains! the villains! And
to think that my name is being execrated throughout
the world.”</p>

<p>The Emperor looked about him uneasily.</p>

<p>“And now, Herr Siebenhaar, what am I to tell
them on my return? That your marvellous island is
the gift of God to the Fatter people?”</p>

<p>“Say nothing,” replied Siebenhaar, “except that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
Mr. Ultimus Samways wishes to see the war. We
are neutral territory. If we have damaged Bondon
we have in coming here cleared your minefields and
we propose to keep your fleet bottled up and shall
destroy it unless Mr. Samways returns in safety
within a week.”</p>

<p>“We have had a delightful talk and it has been
refreshing to me to discover a philosopher who is
greater than an Emperor.”</p>

<p>Siebenhaar laughed and said he looked forward to
the day when capitalists and contractors discovered
that the world contained a power greater than their
own.</p>

<p>“I also,” said the Emperor, “possess an island.
I shall be happy when the war is over and I can retire
to it and live in peace and devote myself to the
delightful and harmless pursuit of painting bad pictures.”</p>

<p>He promised that an airship should be sent for
Ultimus, and said good-bye cordially and regretfully.
As he put his helmet on he said:</p>

<p>“I have to wear this infernal thing, though it always
gives me a headache.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Siebenhaar to Ultimus, “you have
seen the unhappy individual who is called the man-eater
of Europe.”</p>

<p>“Was that the Emperor?” asked the chambermaid.
“Why, they told me he had a tail and always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
walked about with bleeding baby’s legs in his
hands!”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIV: WAR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> airship was a great delight to the inventive
genius of Ultimus. He had it brought to earth on
the shore and examined the engines and propellers,
and its ingenious steering apparatus. The officer in
charge of it was discreet and silent, a stiff martial
gentleman whose intelligence and humanity were
completely hidden by his uniform. He had brought
a declaration to be signed by Ultimus, saying that he
was a non-belligerent and did not represent any
newspaper. For Siebenhaar he had brought a
bundle of newspapers of every country so that he
might read what the nations were saying of each
other.</p>

<p>At last Ultimus’ curiosity was satisfied, and he
stepped into the observation car, the engines started
purring and the great fish-shaped balloon rose into
the air.</p>

<p>Ultimus was surprised to see how little his island
was and when they passed over into Fatterland he
cried:</p>

<p>“Why, there is room for everybody! How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
wrong I was to hate the Fattish for being so many!
Why do not some of them come and live here if there
is no room for them on their island?”</p>

<p>“They’d have a warm time of it if they did,” said
the officer.</p>

<p>“Why? Don’t you like the Fattish?”</p>

<p>“They are pirates and thieves. They are jealous
of our honest commercial success. They and they
only are responsible for this war. They have set
half the nations of Europe to attack us, but they attack
in vain. We are glorious warriors, but they
are only commercial travellers.”</p>

<p>“In Fatland,” replied Ultimus, “they say that
they are glorious warriors, but you are only machines.
And they say that you are jealous of their
Empire, and for years have been planning to destroy
their fleet.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” said the officer.</p>

<p>They had been thousands of feet in the air, often
above the clouds.</p>

<p>“We are approaching the western frontier.”</p>

<p>They descended. A booming and roaring came
up and a queer crackling sound. There were flashes
of light and puffs of smoke, but nowhere were there
signs of any men save far, far away on the roads behind
the lines of smoke and flashes of light.</p>

<p>“That,” said the officer, “is the war.”</p>

<p>“But where are the men who are doing it?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>The officer pointed to black zigzag parallel lines
in the ground.</p>

<p>“They are there. Those are trenches. They
are impregnable. Years ago, at the beginning of
the war there was some barbarous fighting with bayonets,
but since we took up those positions there is
nothing but what you see. Each year makes
those positions stronger, nothing can move the
armies from them. While the war lasts, they will
be held. Is it not splendid? It is just the same on
the eastern frontier, though the line there is a hundred
miles longer. Ah! It is the greatest war the
world has ever seen.”</p>

<p>They came lower until they could see into the
trenches. There were men playing cards, others
sleeping; another was vomiting. Another was buttoning
up his trousers when his head was blown off.
His body stood for a moment with his hand fumbling
at his buttons. Then it collapsed ridiculously.
One of the men who was playing wiped a card on
his breeches and then played it. Another man went
mad, climbed out of the trenches and rushed screeching
in the direction whence the missile had come.</p>

<p>“I have seen enough,” said Ultimus. “Why do
they go there?”</p>

<p>“Because if they did not Fatterland would be
overrun with the savages hired by the Fattish.”</p>

<p>“Would that be worse?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“It would not last so long,” replied the officer,
“but we should have lost our honour as a nation.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Ultimus, “is exactly how the most
beautiful woman in Fatland talks. What is this
honour?”</p>

<p>“It is holy,” said the officer with so fatuously fervent
an expression that Ultimus laughed.</p>

<p>“Does your Highness wish to see the eastern
frontier?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. That is enough.”</p>

<p>The airship soared up. It was now night. The
stars came out and Ultimus mused:</p>

<p>“Out of all the planets why should this be tortured
with the life of men? Is it their vast numbers
that drive them mad? Or are they so vile that war
is their normal condition and peace only a rest from
it?”</p>

<p>For the first time Ultimus responded to the beauty
of the world. They flew low over mountains, and
great rivers and wide valleys. The variety of it all
entranced him, accustomed as he was to the monotony
of the sea and the narrow limitations of the island.
Apart from the horror of war it was amazing
to him that men should desert such loveliness to
spend their days in holes dug in the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XV: SIEBENHAAR ON SOCIETY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> on the island the philosopher and the
chambermaid lived through difficult hours. The
girl wept without ceasing and said if she had known
how dull it was going to be she never would have
come. Remembering Arabella’s dissatisfaction,
Siebenhaar said:</p>

<p>“Women have no resources within themselves.
They take life too seriously. It is never amusing to
them. Society is organised for their protection and
amusement and they take no interest in it, and let
men, who are only worried or irritated by it, bring it
to ruin without a protest. Women are the criminals
who are responsible for everything, for they encourage
men in their vanity and weaken them in their
power. They desire safety, and detest originality,
intellect, imagination.”</p>

<p>The chambermaid sobbed: “I thought it was
going to be fun to be a Queen, but there is no fun in
reigning over sticks and stones.”</p>

<p>“Women,” said Siebenhaar, “want their lovers
and their babies and their fun. When they have to
choose between the three, they choose their fun.
No. They are not the criminals; it is men who are
that for letting them have their fun to keep them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
quiet. Oh! Ultimus, that was a true instinct of
yours to destroy them in their thousands!”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVI: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ultimus</span> was gone exactly a week, during which
time he saw all the preparations for the war, the
countless widows and orphans created by it, the stoppage
of other business, the immense activity at arsenals,
boot factories, and cloth mills, and chemical
laboratories, the soup kitchens for the starving,
among whom he was horrified to see thousands of
men who had returned maimed from the trenches.
What perhaps appalled him most was the gaiety
of the children.</p>

<p>He mentioned this to Siebenhaar on his return.
The philosopher said:</p>

<p>“They have been born since the war began and
do not conceive of life being otherwise.”</p>

<p>“It must end,” said Ultimus, and he sank into a
deep reverie. The strangest result of his experience
was that the sight of the little chambermaid filled
him with disgust. When he thought of the peaceful
and profoundly stirring existence out of which he and
Siebenhaar had come he could not but contrast it
with the obscene excitement in which he had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
her. That she could accept and welcome his embraces
when she knew, as he did not, the bestiality
towards maintaining which the energies of Europe
were devoted, filled him with so bitter an anguish
that he could hardly endure the sight of her. When
he thought that he and she might be bringing another
life into a world made so unworthy of human
life, then he thought that he could never forgive her.
His impulse was to escape, to leave the benighted
nations to their fate, but, when he thought of the suffering
he had seen, he found that he was bound to
them by more than curiosity. He had seen war and
could not rest until he had done his utmost to expunge
it from the minds of men. He had lived in a
pure happiness familiar with all the intellectual discoveries
of the human mind; now he had gained the
love of beauty and a more passionate incentive to
live. What room was there now among all those
millions of men for intellect and beauty?</p>

<p>Siebenhaar had made good use of the newspapers.</p>

<p>“It is clear to me,” he said, “that this war happened
through stupidity and jealousy. They all invented
excuses for it after the outbreak of hostilities.
There is no reason why it should not end as suddenly
as it began. It is too much to expect men debauched
by fifteen years of war to see reason, but they will
understand force. We will use force.”</p>

<p>Together they drew up the following manifesto:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Samways Island, &#160; &#160; &#160; <br />
Off Europe.</span></p>

<p>We, the undersigned, lately arrived in Europe, on
discovering its unanimous betrayal of civilisation,
hereby declare as follows:</p>

<p>(1) We have destroyed Bondon.</p>

<p>(2) The power which did that will be used
against any of the present belligerents not consenting
to lay down their arms.</p>

<p>(3) Upon the declaration of peace the fleets of
the hostile nations are to be collected and sunk, the
guns and ammunition of the various disbanded
armies having first been laded in them. Neutral
nations will then be invited by us to destroy their
fleets and disband their armies.</p>

<p>(4) Nations in future will have no high political
relations with each other except through a central
government.</p>

<p>(5) Recognising the natural pugnacity of the
human race and its love of spectacular effect, we suggest
that in future nations which arrive at a complete
misunderstanding should, with the consent of
the central government, declare war on each other
for a period of not less than one week and not more
than one month, the nations to place in the firing line
only the incurably diseased, the incorrigibly criminal,
the lunatic and the imbecile, and all of those convicted
of exploitation and profit-sharing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>(6) Not more than two thousand men are to be
employed on either side, and the sphere of operations
is to be narrowly limited. If desired, and to
encourage a knowledge of the horror of war, we suggest
that such wars be paid for by admitting spectators
at a price.</p>

<p>(7) Wars are only to take place in August.</p>

<p>(8) Naval war is to be prohibited altogether as
too barbarous. The central government will maintain
an armed fleet for the suppression of pirates.</p>

<p>(9) Weapons and machines designed for the destruction
of human life are only to be manufactured
by the central government.</p>

<p>(10) Acknowledging that follies do not die easily
and that nations at war will always desire territory
as a trophy, we are willing to place the island at the
service of the central government as the prize to be
fought for. It can always be found by wireless.</p>

<p>(11) We submit that there shall be no discussion
of the terms of settlement until the central government
is set up and a proper tribunal is constituted to
deal with all claims. The first step in the interest of
parties is disarmament, and upon that we insist.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) &#160; &#160; &#160; <span class="smcap">Ignatz Siebenhaar.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Ultimus Samways.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVII: PEACE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> manifesto was transmitted by wireless to all
parts of the world. It was published in the newspapers
of America, and therefore could not be suppressed
by the various National Committees for
Keeping the Public in the Dark. Ultimus received
invitations to all the capitals of the belligerent nations.
He said that if they had anything to say they
could say it by wireless. Meanwhile if nothing was
said the Fatter fleet would be destroyed within a
week: the Fattish fleet immediately after it: and
the various ports and capitals would one by one meet
the fate of Bondon.</p>

<p>A great deal was said. Almost every day mean
little men, who looked as though they had been fat
only a short time before and then scorched, arrived
to offer Ultimus his own price for his new explosive.
They all said the same thing: the enemy alone was
responsible for the war and it would never end until
the enemy was destroyed. Therefore, in the interests
of civilisation and universal peace, Mr. Samways
ought to sell, nay, give to humanity the secret
of his invention.</p>

<p>“I am using it in the interests of civilisation,” said
he, “and, as you see, I am resisting all temptation to
make money out of it. The proper use of an explosive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
is that for which I made mine, namely, to destroy
every ugly and useless thing I had made.”</p>

<p>And the mean little men went away. Two of
them committed suicide on their way back to shore,
so troubled were they at being deprived of the monopoly
which had enabled them to drive millions of
men to the slaughter that the rest might be miserable
slaves in their hands.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these two had been ruined by
the destruction of Bondon, upon which they had been
dependent for the world-wide circulation of their
credit.</p>

<p>Day after day brought the news of the suicide of
one great financier after another, and the army contractors,
realising that they might not be paid for
their efforts, abandoned them. No food or supplies
reached the armies, which came home in search of
food. The Emperors of Fatterland and Grossia
fled to their country estates. The Emperor of
Waltzia had been dead for ten years, though his
death had been concealed.</p>

<p>Before long a number of intelligent men from
every country had met in Scandinavia and a central
government was proclaimed. The Fattish, Fatter,
Grossian, Waltzian, and Coqdorian fleets were collected
in the North Sea, and Ultimus had the great
satisfaction of driving the island through them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVIII: THE RETURN OF THE ISLAND</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now Ultimus could breathe again. Came the
news every day of tremendous rejoicings in all the
countries, and in all the name of Ultimus Samways
was blessed. He was asked by every one of them
to anchor his island off their shores, but he replied:</p>

<p>“Not until the lunatic that is in every European
is dead, can I dwell among you. It is easy for you,
whose lives are shallow to forget. But I have seen
and suffered and I cannot forget. When you have
discovered the depths in your own lives and each
man recognises the profound wonder of every other,
then will the thought of the philosopher Siebenhaar
be as fertile seed among you and you will reap the
harvest of brotherhood.”</p>

<p>When he had sent this message to the United
States of Europe he sought out the little chambermaid
and said to her:</p>

<p>“I beg your forgiveness. I have let the horror
of war break in upon my devotion to you. We are
making for the Southern Seas. If you prefer it you
can retire to Bondon, though I must warn you that
your luxurious hotel is now a hospital for the cure of
astute business men.”</p>

<p>The little chambermaid replied:</p>

<p>“I did want to go to see the fun when peace was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
declared, having seen the fun in the streets when
they declared war. But it’s come over me now that
I love you and only you, and I want to be by your
side to give you all the happiness you have brought
into my heart.”</p>

<p>And Siebenhaar said:</p>

<p>“This is a mystery past the understanding of
men, but the understanding is its servant.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I: HISTORY</h3>

<p>I, <span class="smcap">Conrad P. Lewis</span>, of Crown Imperial, Pa.,
U.S.A., do hereby declare that the following narrative
of my adventures is a plain truthful tale with
nothing added or taken away. At the end of a long
life I am able to remember unmoved things that for
many years I could not call to mind without horror
and disgust. Even now I cannot see the charming
person of my daughter without some faint discomfort,
to be rid of which (for I would die in peace) I
have determined to write my story.</p>

<p>The whole civilised world will remember how,
during the years when Europe was sunk under the
vileness of a scientific barbarism, there was suddenly
an end of news from Fatland. Our ships that sailed
for her ports did not return. Her flag had disappeared
from the high seas. Her trade had entirely
ceased. She exported neither coal nor those manufactured
goods which had carried her language, customs,
and religion to the ends of the earth. Her
colonies (we learned) had received only a message
to say that they must in future look after themselves,
as, indeed, they were as capable of doing as any
other collection of people. In one night Fatland
ceased to be.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>It was at first assumed that her enemies the Fatters
had invaded and captured her, but, clearly, they
would not destroy her commerce. Moreover, the
Fatters were at that time and for many years afterwards
living in a state of siege, keeping nine hostile
nations at bay upon their frontiers. This was the
last of the great wars, leading, as we now know, to
the abolition of the idea of nationality, which endowed
a nation with the attributes of a vain and insolent
human being, so that its actions were childish
and could only be made effective by force. When
that idea died in the apathy and suffering and bitterness
of the years following the great wars then the
glorious civilisation which we now enjoy became possible.</p>

<p>The disappearance of Fatland took place shortly
after the outbreak of hostilities, which, from the
practice which the Europeans had in those days, was
always accomplished with great expedition. Every
four years or so, when the exhausted nations once
more had enough young men over eighteen, there
would be some little quarrel, or an arranged assassination,
or an ambassador would be indiscreet. One
war, I remember, broke out over a scuffle between
two bakers in the streets of Bondon: they were a Fattishman
and a Fatter, and they had been arguing
over the merits of the Fattish loaf and the continental
bâton. The Press of both countries took it up:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
their governments had a good class of troops that
year and they did not hesitate to use them. We, in
the Western world, were accustomed to it by then
and knew how to keep our trade alive through neutral
countries. Also, I regret to say, we had engaged
upon the dreadful traffic in war material. In
those days we were still bounded by the primitive
civilisation of Europe. We had not been wakened
to manhood and the way of life and eternity, we had
not been taught to be elemental in our own elemental
continent by the sublime masterpiece of Junius F.
Hohlenheim.</p>

<p>When it became clear that Fatland could not be
in the hands of the Fatters: when, moreover, we
were told that she was taking no part in the last and
bloodiest of the wars, and when, after many months,
there came no news of any kind, then our merchant-monarchs
(now happily extinct) fitted out an expedition,
with credentials to the Fattish Government, if
any. Wild rumors had spread that the Gulf Stream
was diverted, making the Skitish islands uninhabitable,
but I had just then returned from a voyage to
Norroway and knew that it was not so. I had gazed
at the coasts of the mysterious islands with pity, with
curiosity, with sad and, I must own it, sentimental
longing. Were they not our home? We were still
colonists in those days, always looking to other lands
than that in which we lived. “O Fatland,” I cried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
“O mother inviolate!” But we had the captain’s
wife on board and she laughed and said that was not
the adjective to apply to a mother.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">II: CASTAWAY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> my return I married and put my savings into my
father-in-law’s brush-making business, which was almost
at once ruined, and I had to go to sea again.
Government money had been got for the expedition
I told you of, and I knew that pay would be higher
on that account. I sent in an application, and, having
an uncle well placed, was taken on as third officer.
A dirty little gunboat had been put in commission,
and directly I set eyes on her I knew the
voyage would be unlucky. We were but three days
out when we had trouble with the propeller shaft
and were carried far north among the ugliest ice I
ever saw, and narrowly escaped being caught in a
floe. Fortunately we ran into a southward current
in the nick of time and, with a fresh wind
springing up, were quickly out of danger. However,
the years of war had added another peril
to those of nature. We fouled a mine among the
islands of Smugland and were blown to bits. At the
time I was standing near a number of petrol cans,
and when I came to the surface of the water I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
some of them floating near me. I tied six of them
together and they made a tidy little raft, though it
was very uncomfortable. On them I drifted for
four days until hunger and thirst were too much for
me and I swooned away. I was then past agony and
my swoon was more like passing into an enchantment
than a physical surrender.</p>

<p>I was not at all astonished, therefore, when I came
to my senses to find myself in a bed with a man sitting
by my bedside. Very glad was I to see him, and
I cried out in a big voice:</p>

<p>“Kerbosh! If I ain’t got into heaven by mistake.”</p>

<p>The man shook his head sadly and said:</p>

<p>“Heaven? No.”</p>

<p>But I could not shake off the feeling that I was in
Heaven. The man had long hair and a beard, and
I could be pardoned for taking him for Peter. He
wore a rough shift, a long kilt below his knees, and
thick stockings, and by his elbow on a little table,
was another stocking which he had been knitting.
He gave me food and drink, and I at once felt
stronger, but somewhat squeamish, so that the sense
of hallucination clung about me. When I asked
where I was, the man tiptoed to the door, opened it
and listened, then returned to my bedside and said in
a whisper:</p>

<p>“It is as much as my place is worth, but I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
warn you as man to man to make good your escape
while you may. As man to man, I say it, man to
man.”</p>

<p>He was so terribly excited as he said this that I
decided in my own mind that he was a harmless lunatic,
one of the many whom the great wars had rendered
idiotic. To humour him I repeated:</p>

<p>“As man to man.”</p>

<p>And I put out my hand. He seized it and said in
a desperate voice:</p>

<p>“I am old enough to be your fa——”</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded on the stairs and in absolute
terror he stopped, took up his knitting and plied the
needles frantically.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">III: MY CAPTOR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> footsteps came up to the door of the room in
which I lay. The door opened to reveal a truly remarkable
figure; plump, short, with a tousled mop
of reddish-grey hair and a wide, pleasant, weather-beaten
face. This figure was clad in a loose blue
coat and Bulgarian trousers, very baggy about the
hips and tight about the calves; not at all an unbecoming
costume, though it both puzzled and pained
me. So much so that I pretended to be asleep, for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
was averse to being made to speak to this strange
object. A woman’s voice addressed the man with
the knitting and asked him how I was. He replied
that I had come to my senses and gone to sleep again.
As luck would have it, the food I had eaten so hastily
began just then to cause me acute discomfort,
and my body, escaping my control, relieved itself
after its fashion. Thereupon the woman, perceiving
that I was malingering, fell upon me and shook
me until my teeth rattled and delivered herself of an
oration upon the deceitfulness of man. I was still
suffering acutely and could offer no resistance, though
I cried out that I was an American citizen and neutral
and should have the matter brought to the ears
of my Government.</p>

<p>“In this country,” said my assailant, “men are
men and are treated as such, and we do not recognize
the existence of any other country in the world.
You will get up now and place your superior strength
at the service of those who feed you and as far as
possible justify your existence.”</p>

<p>The man with the knitting had crept from the
room. He returned with a shift, a kilt and stockings
like his own. I was made to put these on, the
woman, in defiance of all decency, watching me and
talking shrilly all the time. Then she drove the
man and myself out of doors and set us to work at
hoeing in a field of turnips, while she whistled to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
dog that came bounding over a hedge, and trudged
off in the direction of a wood.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” said I. “Is she your wife?”</p>

<p>“Wife?” answered he. “Wife! There is
neither marriage nor giving in marriage. She is a
farmer, and I, who was once a Professor of Economics,
am her labourer. Intellectually I am in despair,
but physically I am in such rude health that I
cannot entertain the thought of self-destruction long
enough to commit the act. She is my niece, and
when the change came she undertook, as all women
did, to provide work for her male relatives above a
certain age.”</p>

<p>“Change?” I whispered. “What change?”</p>

<p>“Have you not heard?” he said. “Is the country
severed from the civilised world?”</p>

<p>I informed him of the expedition which I had
joined. He gave a long hopeless sigh and fell into
a great silence which moved me far more than his
words had done. We plied our hoes in the immense
field which was situated in a desolate region of slight
undulations the outlines of which were blurred with
rank growth.</p>

<p>Presently I broke in upon his silence to ask his
name.</p>

<p>“I was,” he murmured, “I was Professor Ian
Baffin.”</p>

<p>“Can it be possible?” I cried, for the fame of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
that great man was world-wide, and during the notorious
Anti-Trust elections in my country his works
had been in every cultured home. I told him this,
but it brought him no comfort.</p>

<p>“At the time of the change,” he said, “I and
fifty other Professors and Fellows of Colleges published
a manifesto in which we pointed out the disasters
that must ensue, and we even went so far as to
promise them degrees at the major universities, but
the change came and the universities were destroyed.”</p>

<p>“What change?” I asked again.</p>

<p>He leaned on his hoe and gazed toward the setting
sun.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IV: THE CHANGE</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">About</span> the tenth year of the second of the great
wars,” he said, “there was a convulsion in the country.
A young idealist appeared who with fiery and
vulgar eloquence proclaimed that war was the triumph
of the old over the young, to whom since the
world began justice had never been done. The old,
he said, were in the position of trustees who had betrayed
their trust and instead of working for the
benefit of the endless army of the young who came
after them, devoted all their energies to robbing
them of their birthright. To extricate themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
from the punishment which must otherwise have fallen
on them they exploited the courage and love of
adventure of the young and set them to destroy each
other. So successful had they been in this device
that they could count on using it at least once in every
generation, and politicians knew that when they were
at the end of their tether they could always procure
a continuance of their offices and emoluments by declaring
war. This had been the condition of civilised
existence for so many thousands of years that
it was generally accepted and the truth was never
suspected until our young idealist arrived with honey
on his lips for the young and gall and bitter invective
for the old. He rushed up and down the country
persuading young men on no condition to take up
arms. ‘Government?’ he said. ‘What government
do you need except such as will provide you
with roads, railways, lighting, bread for the incapacitated,
and drainage for all?’ I signed a manifesto
against him too. His ignorance of economics was
pitiful. In the end martial law was proclaimed and
he was shot. The young men did not listen to him,
but the young women did. Shooting him was a mistake.
It gave his name the magic of martyrdom.
By the thousand, women, old, young, and middle-aged,
cherished his portrait in their bosoms, prayed
to him in secret, vowed themselves to his cause, and
remained chaste. Nunneries were founded in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
name, but so potent was the spell of his martyrdom,
so overwrought were the women of this country by
the many crises through which we have passed, that
amid all the temptations of life they were dedicated
to his memory and preserved their virginity. They
said if the country can find no better use for our sons
than to send them to the slaughter and disablement,
we will breed no sons. The Government was
warned, but like all governments they could not see
beyond the system by which they governed, and
when at last they were convinced that something serious
was happening, they could think of no other remedy
than that of giving votes, i.e. a share in the system
by which they enjoyed their positions. At first,
to show their contempt for the Government, the
women did not use their votes until the country was
shown by an energetic and public-spirited woman
that another war was in the making. An election
was forced and the Government was defeated. At
the conclusion of the second great war you may remember
that Bondon was destroyed, and with it the
Houses of Parliament and the Royal Palace. A
new capital was chosen, but as Fatland was no longer
the center of the world’s credit system, finance had
lost its old power. A new type of politician had
arisen, who, in order to win favour with the women,
set himself to do all in his power to make government
impossible. The enormous numerical superiority of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the women made their leaders paramount in the
land, though there was still officially a Cabinet and a
House of Swells. On the third and last outbreak
of hostilities the officials made their final despairing
effort and declared war on Fatterland, but they had
no army. They had been unable to rebuild their
fleet as all the other countries had done. They were
helpless. The Cabinet and the House of Swells, to
set an example to the country, armed themselves and
went to the front, taking with them the last ten thousand
young men in the country. They never returned
and the country was left populated solely by
old men, cripples, and women, of whom a few thousand
were pregnant. These were interned. A
committee of influential women was formed and issued
a decree that Fatland would henceforth have no
share in male civilisation. Men had, to cut a long
story short, made a mess of things, and women
would now see what they could do. They began by
abolishing property in land. The first, the only important
thing was to feed the population. The
State guaranteed to everybody food, housing, and
clothes. Able-bodied women were to take charge of
their male relatives and make them useful. Decent
women, that is to say virgins, were to work on the
land. All women guilty of childbirth were to be
sent to work in the factories. I cannot remember
all the laws made, for my memory has been impaired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
by my sufferings, but they were all dictated by an
unreasoning and venomous hatred of men. We are
little better than slaves. They laugh at us affectionately,
but they despise and ignore our thoughts.
They have defied every economic law, but astonishingly
they continue to live.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said I, “the world goes on. The sun
sets and will rise as it has done these millions of
years, with change upon change, folly upon folly beneath
it. We turn up the earth for the food we eat
and so we live. Truly I think there is some wisdom
in these women.”</p>

<p>The sun went down, a bell rang in the farmhouse,
we shouldered our hoes and returned thither, each
busy with his own thoughts.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">V: THE HOMESTEAD</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> my annoyance I found that the bell was not a
summons to a meal, but to a meeting of the family
of five women for a kind of a service. This consisted
in reading aloud from the speeches of William
Christmas, the idealist who had provoked this monstrous
state of affairs. His portrait hung on the
wall opposite the door, and I must confess that his
face was singularly beautiful. The woman who
had roused me from my bed read a passage beginning:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
“The tyranny of the old is due to their stupidity,
which neither young men nor women have
yet had the patience to break through.” And as she
closed the book she said, “Thus spake William
Christmas.” Whereupon the other women muttered,
“of blessed memory, which endureth for ever
and ever. Amen.” These women were plain and
forbidding. Their eyes were fixed on the portrait
with a dog-like subjection which I found most repulsive.
They stood transfixed while the woman-farmer
declaimed: “For guidance, William Christmas,
spirit of woman incarnate, we look to thee in
the morning and in the evening, in our goings out and
our comings in, and woe to her who stumbles on the
way of all flesh into the snares of men.” On that
the five of them turned and glared sorrowfully at my
old friend and me until I was hard put to it not to
laugh. The meeting then came to an end, and we
were told to prepare supper. We withdrew to the
kitchen, and there Professor Baffin began to snigger,
and when I asked him what amused him he said:</p>

<p>“The joke of it is that this Christmas, like all
idealists, was as great a lecher as Julius Cæsar. It
was his lechery made his position in the old order
of society impossible.”</p>

<p>I laughed too, for I had begun dimly to understand
the passion which moved these virgins in their
chastity, and I was filled with a fierce hatred of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
lot of them, and resolved as soon as possible to escape.</p>

<p>We cooked a meal of fish and eggs, and having
laid the table we had to wait on the family. I was
struck by the triviality of their discourse and the absence
from it of any general argument. The five
women twittered like sparrows in mid-winter and not
once did they laugh. They talked of the condition
of their beasts and their crops, and so earnest, so
careful were they that I understood that it must be
barren soil indeed that would resist their efforts.
They were discussing what goods they would requisition
from the district store in return for their contribution
to the State granaries. I wondered if they
had succeeded in abolishing money, and upon enquiry
I found that they had. The Professor told me that
they had abolished everything which before the
change had made them dependent upon men and
their pleasure.</p>

<p>“But why do you men stand it?” I cried.</p>

<p>“We would starve else. We have no credit.
Contributions to the State granaries are not accepted
from men, nor are men allowed to trade direct with
the stores.”</p>

<p>“But cannot they revolt and use their strength?”</p>

<p>“The strange thing is,” said the Professor, “that
men cannot now endure the sight of each other.
They are as jealous of each other as women were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the old days. Besides, writing is forbidden, and no
book is allowed save the posthumous works of the
lecherous William. The libraries were destroyed
on the same day as the arsenals. Intelligence is
gagged. Thrift and a terrible restless activity are
now our only virtues.”</p>

<p>“And art?”</p>

<p>“Art? How should there be art? It was never
more than the amusement of women in their idleness.
They are no longer idle and I must admit
that they are admirably methodical in their work,
energetic and straightforward as men never were.
But it is ill living in a woman-made world and I shall
not be sorry when death comes.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VI: OBSEQUIES</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Death</span> came to the old man that night, and so surprised
him that he was unable to feel anything. I
had been put to sleep in the same room with him and
was awakened by his talking. He was delivering
himself of what sounded like a lecture, but he broke
off in the middle to say:</p>

<p>“This is very astonishing. I am going to die.”</p>

<p>I struck a light, and there he was lying with a
smile of incredulity upon his face, and I thought that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
if we were sentient beings when we were born, so
and not otherwise we would accept the gift of life.
So and not otherwise do we greet all manifestations
of life which have not become familiar through
habit.</p>

<p>I was grateful to the old man for giving me the
key to my own frame of mind. I spoke to him, but
he was dead.</p>

<p>His loud discourse had roused the mistress of the
house who came knocking at the door, saying:</p>

<p>“Baffin, if you don’t behave yourself I shall come
and tickle you.”</p>

<p>So astounded and outraged was I at this address
that I leapt out of my bed, donned my kilt, and said:</p>

<p>“Come in, woman, and see what you have done.
This learned old man, whose mind was one of the
glories of the world, has been driven to his death,
starved, deprived of the intellectual habits through
which a long life had been——”</p>

<p>I got no further, for the woman flung herself upon
me and tickled my sides and armpits until I shrieked.
Two other women came rushing up and held me on
the floor, and then with a feather they tickled my
feet until I was nearly mad. I wept and cried for
mercy, and at last they desisted and withdrew, leaving
me with the corpse, to which they paid not the
slightest attention.</p>

<p>The next morning I was told to dig a grave and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
to prepare the body for burial. There was no more
ceremony than in a civilised country is given to the
interment of a dog, and in the house I only heard the
old man referred to twice. The youngest of the
women said, “He was a dear old idiot,” but the mistress
of the house shut her mouth like a trap on the
words: “One the less.”</p>

<p>But a day or two later I found upon the grave a
pretty wreath of wild flowers, and that evening under
a hedge I came on a little girl, who was crying
softly to herself. I had not seen her before and was
puzzled to know where she came from. She said
her name was Audrey and she lived at the next farm,
where they were very unkind to her, and she used to
meet the old man in the fields and he was very nice
to her, and when she heard he was dead she wanted
to die too. The men on the farm were rough and
dirty, and the women were all spiteful and suspicious.</p>

<p>When I asked her if she had put the wreath on my
old friend’s grave, she was frightened and made me
promise not to tell anyone. Of course I promised,
and I took her home. As we parted we engaged to
meet again in the wood half-way between our two
houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VII: SLAVERY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my own country I have often remarked the cruel
lack of consideration with which women treat their
servants, but here I was appalled by the bland inhumanity
of the conduct of these women toward myself.
I was given no wages and no liberty. (I
could not keep my engagement with Audrey.) I
was a hind, and lived in horror of the degradation
into which I saw that I must sink. Day after day
of the cruel work of the fields brought me to a torpid
condition in which I could but blindly obey the orders
given me when I returned home. Especially I
dreaded the evenings on those days when the mistress
of the house went to the district stores, for she
always returned out of temper and found fault with
everything I did. Also, when she was out of temper,
her readings from the Book of Christmas were
twice as long as usual.</p>

<p>I was some weeks in this melancholy condition,
not knowing how I could make my escape and indeed
despairing of it, when I was sent on a message
to the next farm. On the way back I met Audrey,
at the sight of whose young beauty I forgot the despair
which latterly had seized me. I rushed to
her and caught her up in my arms and kissed her.
Thereupon she said she would never go back, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
would stay with me forever. I could not deny her,
for I had found in her the incentive which I had lost
in my growing indifference to my fate. She was but
a child, and the only gracious being I had met in this
ill-fated country. Hand in hand we wandered until
dusk, when I hid her in the hay-loft and returned to
my duties.</p>

<p>I was severely chidden for my long absence and
ordered during the next week to wear the Skirt of
Punishment, a garment of the shape fashionable
among women at the time of the great change.
Poor Audrey could not help laughing when she saw
me in it, but having no other clothes I had to put off
all thought of escape until I was released from punishment.
Never before had I realised how cramped
the mind could become from the confinement of the
legs. My week in a skirt came very near to breaking
my spirit. Another four days of it and I believe
I should have grovelled in submissive adoration before
my tyrant. Only my nightly visits to Audrey
kept me in courage and resolution.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VIII: A STRANGE WOOING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> youngest of the women in the homestead was
the last to speak to me. She was dark and not uncomely,
and I had often noticed her at the readings
smile rather fearfully at her own thoughts. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
my eyes had met hers and I was shocked by the direct
challenge of her gaze. At the time I was disturbed
and uneasy, but soon forgot and took no notice
of the woman except that I felt vaguely that she
was unhappy. But soon I was always meeting her.
I would find her lurking in the rooms as I came to
scrub and clean them. Or she would appear in the
lane as I came home from the fields, or I would meet
her in the doorway, so that I could not help brushing
against her. A little later I missed one of my stockings
as I got up in the morning and had to go barefoot
until I had knitted another pair.</p>

<p>One night as I was creeping off to my poor Audrey,
now deadly weary of her close quarters in the
hay, to my horror I met this woman clad in her
night attire. She vanished and I went my way
thoroughly frightened. I told Audrey to be ready
to come with me next day, for we were spied upon
and could not now wait, as we had planned, until my
little thefts from the larder had given us a sufficient
store of food.</p>

<p>Nothing happened the next day and I gave up my
determination to ransack the larder. That night as
I opened the door I found the woman pressed
against it, so that she fell almost into my arms. She
clung to me wildly, assured me that I was the most
beautiful man she had ever seen, and tried to press
me back into my room, her tone, her whole bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
conveying an invitation about which it was impossible
to be mistaken. It chilled me to the heart, coming
as it did so suddenly out of the coldness engendered
by the rigid separation of the sexes and the
deliberate humiliation of men in that woman-ridden
region. As gently as I could I put her from me,
though it was not so easy, and I rushed out into the
night. I could not tell Audrey what had happened,
but as soon as I saw her I felt that the moment for
our escape had come. If we did not seize it I should
be denounced and tickled, if not worse. We crept
away and made straight across the fields and at dawn
hid in a wood.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IX: THE RUINED CITY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> relieved to hear from Audrey that there were
no newspapers. She told me that a man from her
farm had run away but was never found. There
were always new men coming, because it was impossible
for them to obtain food except what they could
kill. In the summer there were always men wandering
about the country, but they came back in the
winter and were glad to work for their board and
lodging. I soon understood this, for when we had
exhausted our store we were often a whole day without
a morsel passing our lips, and I began to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
foolhardiness of my attempt at liberty. Again and
again I besought Audrey to leave me, but she would
not. She could always have obtained a meal for
herself had she gone alone to a house, but wherever
I went I was asked for my registered number, and
at first had not the readiness to invent one. At last
I told one woman I was 8150. She asked me what
district and I did not know. On that she bundled
me out and I was lucky to escape detention. When
I asked Audrey about the registration she said all
men were registered with a number and a letter.
The men on her farm had been L.D. Next time I
said I was L.D. 8150, and when asked my business I
said I was taking my young miss to the nunnery at
O. Either my answer was satisfactory or Audrey’s
beauty was the passport it would be in any normal
country, for we were handsomely treated and given
a present of three cheeses to take to the nuns.</p>

<p>We ate the cheeses and were kept alive until,
after a fortnight’s journey, we came on a dismal
mass of blackened buildings. We entered the city,
once world-famous for its textiles, and never have I
been so near the hopelessness of the damned. The
remains of a dead civilisation; decomposing and festering;
grass grew in between the cobbles of the
streets; weeds were rank; creepers covered the walls
of the houses and their filthy windows. Huge factories
were crumbling away, and here and there we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
came on immense piles of bricks where the chimneys
had tumbled down. For miles we walked through
the streets and never saw a soul until as we turned a
corner into a square we came on a sight that made me
think we had reached the lowest Hell.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">X: THE OUTLAWS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a great fire in the middle of the square,
and round this was a tatterdemalion crew of men
and women. They were roasting an ox, and, as
they waited for it, they sang and danced. When we
approached near enough to hear what they were
singing I blushed and felt aggrieved for Audrey.
Many of the men and women were perfectly shameless
in their gestures, and I wished to go back the
way we had come. However, we had been seen,
and were drawn into the light of the fire and asked
to give an account of ourselves. I told them I was
an American citizen only too anxious to return to my
own country now I had seen the pass to which theirs
had been brought. Audrey clung to me, and I said
she was my little cousin whom I had come to deliver,
and that, having wandered hungry for so many days,
we had taken refuge in the town in the hope of faring
better. We were given stools to sit on, and
slices of the best cut of the ox were put before us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
The rest drank spirits and wine from some cellar in
the town and were soon more crazy than ever, and
more obscene, but with my belly full of good meat
I was not offended and preferred their debauchery
to the icy virtue which had so horribly oppressed me
at the homestead. Audrey was excited by it all, but
I knew that her innocence could take no harm.</p>

<p>Presently there was only one man sober besides
myself. He came towards me and invited me to
stay the night in his house where he lived alone
with his son. I liked the looks of the man. He
was poorly clad, but in the old fashion of coat and
trousers, whereas the costumes of the men in the
square were strange and bizarre.</p>

<p>As we walked through the dark streets our new
friend told me that all the great cities of Fatland
were in this condition, abandoned to the dregs of the
population, degraded men and women, idle and lawless,
with the leaven of the few proud spirits who
would not accept the new regime and found a world
governed by women as repulsive as a world governed
by men. I was astonished at this, for I could not
then see, as later I saw, the abomination of civilised
life as I had known it at home. Perhaps a sailor,
for whom life ashore means pleasure and relief from
responsibilities, cannot feel injustice and inequality.
On the sea he has his own way of dealing with those
poisons.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>The house we came to was small but comfortable.
My new friend explained that he was able to keep
alive by dealing with the outlaws, who kept money
current among themselves, and, indeed, had come to
regard him as their counsellor and peacemaker, and
never returned from their raids without bringing him
some tribute. Seeing me dubious of the morality
of this, he explained that under the old order he had
been a shareholder in joint-stock companies and accepted
his share of the profits without scruple as to
how they had been obtained. He told me further
that he was quite alone in the city, and that no one
else maintained the old life. He had registered
himself in compliance with the law, but could not
leave the mathematical work to which his life had
been devoted, for he believed that he would achieve
results which would survive all the vicissitudes of
Fattish civilisation even as the work of Pythagoras
had survived ancient Greece. The number of outlaws,
he said, was growing, and there would eventually
be a revolution, to lead which he was preparing
and educating his son, Edmund. His own sympathies,
he declared, had at first been with the women,
who had been driven to extricate the country from
the vicious circle of war into which it had been
drawn by the egregious folly of men. But when,
having achieved this, they abused their power and,
in the intoxication of their success, defied nature herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
then he had abandoned all hope and had taken
the only means of dissociating himself from the life
of his country, namely, by staying where he was.
To be sure the women had established agriculture on
a sound basis, but it was vain for them to breed cattle
if they would not breed themselves.</p>

<p>I asked him if he was a widower. He said No.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XI: EDMUND</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> man’s son was the most charming boy I ever
set eyes on. He was eighteen, but had the carriage
and assurance of a young man in his prime, most resolute
and happy. He liked talking to me and was
more communicative than his father. For a fortnight
he would work steadily at his books, imbibing
the principles of government in the philosophers
from Plato down. He thought they were all wrong,
said so, and but for his simplicity I should have put
him down as conceited. It was very slowly as I
talked to him that I came to realise the revolution in
thought produced by the great European wars and
the terrible consequences, how fatal they had been
to the old easy idealism. The new spirit in its generous
acceptance of the gross stuff of human nature
and its indomitable search for beauty in it has been
expressed for all time by our poet, Hohlenheim, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
I only need state here that I encountered it for the
first time in that ruined city. Not, however, till
Hohlenheim expressed it did I recognise it.</p>

<p>But for Hohlenheim I could believe in a Providence
when I think of Edmund and Audrey. They
were as bee and flower. The honey of her beauty
drew him and he was hers, she his, from the first moment.
I had regarded her as a child and was
amazed to see how she rejoiced in him. I had expected
more modesty until I reflected how in such
darkness as that which enveloped Fatland love must
blaze. It flared up between them and burned them
into one spirit. So moved was I that all other marriage,
even my own, has always seemed a mockery
to me.</p>

<p>How gracious Audrey was to me! She promised
me that Edmund would hurry up his revolution so
that I could return to my own country, but I was
given to understand that the position was very difficult,
because his own mother was Vice-Chairwoman
of the Governing Committee. For a week at a time
Edmund would be away rounding up outlaws, and,
at great risk, preaching to the kilted and registered
men in the fields. Had he been caught he would
have been tickled to death.</p>

<p>After a time I went with him on his expeditions.
It was amazing how his eloquence and his personality
produced their effect even on the dullest minds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
The stream of men proceeding to the ruined city increased
every day, and we began to have enough
good people to suppress the reckless rioters somewhat
and to organise the life of the town something
after the fashion of the Italian city-state, except that
we made no warlike preparations whatsoever.
Most encouraging of all, we had a growing number
of young women coming into the place, and thankful
as they were to escape the nunneries or the spinsterhood
of the farms, they quickly found mates and produced
children. The birth of every baby was made
a matter of public rejoicing.</p>

<p>But alas! my ill-luck pursued me. On one of our
expeditions we were cut off and surrounded in a field
by a patrol of women. Edmund managed to escape,
but I was captured and tortured into making a confession
of what was going on in the ruined city. I
did not see how my confession could do any harm,
and I don’t know what happened, but though my
friends must have known where I was they made no
attempt to rescue me or to communicate with me.
I think I should have died rather than confess but
for the thought of my wife. My strongest passion
then was to see her again. Let that, if excuse is
needed, be mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XII: THE NUNNERY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Edmund disappeared through a gap in the
hedge I was attacked by a mob of women, screaming
at the top of their voices. They talked me into a
state of stupefaction and led me dazed in the direction
of a great building which I had taken for a factory
or workhouse. Here with the leader of my
captors I was hustled through a little gate with the
mob outside hooting and yelling:</p>

<p>“Man! Man! Man!”</p>

<p>I was flung into a cell and left there to collect my
wits, which I found hard of doing, for I was near
the limits of my endurance, and I did not see how I
could hold out against the numbing influence of such
absolute feminism. In the society to which I had
been accustomed men, whatever their misdeeds, had
always treated women with indulgence, but here the
life of a man was one long expiation for the crime of
having been born. I had spirit enough left in me to
revolt, but my feeling could only express itself in
bitter tears. I wept all night without ceasing, and
the next day I was so weak and ill that I slept from
utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>Bread and water were handed in to me through a
hole in the door, but the bread was sour and the water
was foul to my taste. Once again I fell a victim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
to the sense of hallucination, and when at last
the door of my cell was opened and a human figure
entered I was half-convinced that I was honoured
with a visitation by an angel. I fell on my knees
and the “angel” called me to my senses by saying:</p>

<p>“Fool, get up.”</p>

<p>I obeyed and my visitor informed me that she was
the Medical Superintendent come to inspect me. I
was ordered to strip and stand in the middle of the
cell while the superintendent walked round me and
surveyed me as farmers do with cattle. She prodded
my flesh and asked me my age and what illnesses I
had had. She sounded my lungs and tested my
heart and appeared to be well satisfied. As she
scanned my person there came into her eyes a quizzical,
humorous look, in which there was a certain
kindly pity, so that I was reassured and plucked up
courage to ask where I was and what was going to be
done with me. I was told that I was in the great
nunnery of O, and that my destiny depended upon
her report. I asked her to make it a good one and
she laughed. I laughed too, for indeed mine was a
most ridiculous position, standing there stark naked
under her scrutiny. It became necessary for me to
cover myself, and when I had done so we still stood
there laughing like two sillies. She said:</p>

<p>“You’ll do.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“I can give you a certificate for fatherhood.”</p>

<p>I gasped and protested that I was married, and
expressed my horror of any such misconduct as she
proposed. She ignored my protest and said:</p>

<p>“The mothers of your children will be carefully
chosen for you.”</p>

<p>On that I roared with laughter. The idea was
too preposterous. The superintendent reproved me
and said that any ordinary man would give his eyes
to be in my position, which I owed entirely to my
wonderful physique. I declared my unwillingness
and demanded as an American citizen to be set at
liberty. She told me that the idea of nationality
was not recognised and that I must serve the human
race in the way marked out for me. “How?” said
I. “Marked out for me? By whom?” I was
assured by my own physical fitness. I protested that
I could not look upon fatherhood as a career, but
was told that I must consider it among the noblest.
I maintained that it could never be for a man more
than an incident, significant and delightful no doubt,
but no more to be specialized in than any other natural
function. Argument, however, was impossible,
for on this subject the superintendent’s humour deserted
her. However, her interest was roused and
she was more friendly in her attitude, and consented
to explain to me the institution which she served. It
was not in the old sense a nunnery, for its inmates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
were not vowed to seclusion, and though portraits
of William Christmas were plentiful on its walls,
there was no formal devotion to his memory. It
was literally a garden of girls. Female children
were brought from the affiliated crèches to be trained
and educated for the functions of life to which they
were best fitted. The intelligent were equipped for
the sciences, the strong for agriculture, the quick
and cunning for industry, the beautiful for maternity.
Male children were farmed out and given no instruction
whatever, since they needed no intelligence for
the duties they had to perform. “But the birth-rate?”
I said, and received the answer: “Should
never be such as to complicate the problem of food.
It is better to have a small sensible population than
one which is driven mad by its own multitude.”</p>

<p>I was far from convinced and said: “Such a
world might a student of bees dream of after a late
supper of radishes.”</p>

<p>My new friend replied that I had not lived
through the nightmare of the great wars, or I would
be in a better position to appreciate the blessings of a
scientific society. She admitted that men were
perhaps treated with undue severity, but added that,
for her part, she believed it to be necessary for the
gradual suppression of the masculine conceit and
folly which had for so long ravaged the world. In
time that would right itself, the severity would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
relaxed, and men would assert an undeniable claim to
a due share in the benefits of civilisation. In the
meanwhile, she would do all in her power to befriend
me. I implored her to certify me unfit for fatherhood,
but she would only yield so far as to declare
that I was in need of a month’s recuperation and
distraction.</p>

<p>With that ended my interview with that extraordinary
woman, who in happier circumstances would
have been a glory to her sex.</p>

<p>I was presently removed from my cell to a pleasant
room in the lodge by the gate, and I was made
to earn my keep by working in the garden. At the
end of a week I was despatched by road to the capital
to appear there before the examining committee
of the department of birth.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIII: IN THE CAPITAL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> luck would have it my guardian on the long journey
by road—for motor-cars had not been renounced—was
a little chatterbox of a woman, who
coquetted with me in the innocent and provocative
manner of the born flirt. She meant no harm by it,
but could not control her eyes and gestures. I encouraged
her to make her talk, and she told me it
would have gone hardly with me but that the medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
superintendent had been passing by the gate of
the nunnery as I was thrust in. But for her I should
have been condemned to work in the sewers or to sell
stamps in the post office, menial work reserved for
criminals, for the authorities were becoming exasperated
with the agitation for the rights of men.
The outlaws no one minded. They inhabited the
ruined cities and sooner or later would be starved
out. It was absurd to expect the new society to be
rid altogether of the pests which had plagued the
old, but every reasonable woman was determined
that for generations men should not enjoy the rights
which they had so wantonly abused.</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “men never claimed rights.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered my coquette, “they stole them
when we were not looking. They insisted that we
should all be mothers, so that we should be too busy
to keep them out of mischief.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said I, “it is the women who
have kept us in mischief.”</p>

<p>“No one can say,” she replied, “that we do not
keep you out of it now.” And she gave me one of
those arch involuntary invitations which have before
now been the undoing of Empires. I could not resist
it. I seized her in my arms and kissed her full
on the lips.</p>

<p>I half expected her to stop the car and denounce
me, but when she had made sure that the girl driving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
had not seen she was undisturbed and remarked with
a charming smile:</p>

<p>“Some foreign ways are rather pretty.”</p>

<p>I repeated the offence, and by the journey’s end we
were very good friends and understood each other
extremely well. She agreed with me when I said
that all forms of society were dependent upon a lot
of solemn humbug. She said yes, and she expected
that before she had done she would be put upon her
trial. I did not then understand her meaning, for
we parted at the door of a large house, where she
was given a receipt for me. She saluted me, the
dear little trousered flirt, by putting her finger to her
lips as the car drove off.</p>

<p>There were no women in that house. Its inhabitants
were a number of young men like myself, all
superb in physique and many of them extremely
handsome, but they were all gloomy and depressed.
I was right in guessing them to be other candidates
for fatherhood. They were guarded and served by
very old men in long robes like tea-gowns. Horrible
old creatures they were, like wicked midwives
who vary their habit of bringing human beings into
the world by preparing their dead bodies to leave
it. But the young men were hardly any better:
they were dull, stupid, and listless, and their conversation
was obscene.</p>

<p>We had to spend our time in physical exercise, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
taking baths and anointing our bodies with unguents
and perfumes. We were decked out in beautiful
clothes. Embroidered coats and white linen kilts.
In the evenings there were lectures on physiology,
and we were made to chant a poetical passage from
the works of William Christmas, a description of the
glory of the bridegroom, of which I remember nothing
except an offensive comparison with a stallion.</p>

<p>The humiliation was terrible, and when I remembered
the superintendent speaking of “the mothers
of my children” I was seized with a nausea which I
could not shake off, until, two days after my arrival,
an epidemic of suicide among the candidates horrified
me into a wholesome reaction against my surroundings.
I found it hard to account for the epidemic
until I noticed the coincidence of the disappearance
of the most comely of the young men with
the periodic visits of the high officials. This
pointed, though at first I refused to believe it, to the
vilest abuse of the system set up by the women in
their pathetic attempt to solve the problem of population
scientifically. Far, far better were it had
they been content with their refusal to bear children
and to impose chastity upon all without exception,
and to let the race perish. Must the stronger sex
always seek to degrade the weaker? My experience
in that house filled me with an ungovernable
hatred of women. The sight of them with the absurdities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
of their bodies accentuated by the trousered
costumes they had elected to adopt filled me with
scorn and bitter merriment. The smell of them, to
which in my hatred I became morbidly sensitive,
made me sick. The sound of their voices set my
teeth on edge.</p>

<p>Such was my condition when, after three weeks’
training, I was called before the examination committee.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIV: THE EXAMINATION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> in all my strange experiences astonished
me so much as the lack of ceremony in this matter of
fatherhood. It was approached with a brutal disinterestedness,
a cynical disregard of feeling equalled
only by men of pleasure in other countries. I was
filled with rage when I was introduced to the committee
of middle-aged and elderly women and exposed
to their cold scrutiny. First of all I was told
to stand at the end of the hall and repeat the poem
of William Christmas. I had been made to get it by
heart, but in my distress I substituted the word Ram
for the word Stallion. The chairwoman rapped
angrily on the table.</p>

<p>“Why do you say Ram for Stallion?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>I replied: “Because it more aptly describes
my condition. There is nobility in the stallion, but
the ram is a foolish beast.”</p>

<p>There was a consultation, after which the chairwoman
bade me approach and said:</p>

<p>“Your medical report is excellent but we are
afraid you lack mental simplicity. You are an educated
man.”</p>

<p>“I am an American citizen,” I replied proudly,
“and I protest against the treatment to which I have
been subjected.”</p>

<p>“We know nothing of that,” retorted the chairwoman.
“You are before us as L.D. 8150, recommended
for paternal duties and, if passed, to be entered
in the stud-book. Your record since you have
been in the country is a bad one, but points to the
possession of a spirit which for our purposes may be
valuable.”</p>

<p>I said: “You may call me what you like; you
may register me in any book you please, send me
where you choose, but I am a married man and will
not oblige you.”</p>

<p>Then a fury seized me and I shouted:</p>

<p>“Can you not see that you are driving your people
into madness or disaster, that you will soon be
plunged again into barbarism, that your science is destroying
the very spirit of civilisation? I tell you
that even now, as you work and plan and arrange,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
there is growing a revolt against you, a revolt so
strong that it will ignore you, as life in the end ignores
those who would measure it with a silver rod.”</p>

<p>The chairwoman smiled as she rejoined:</p>

<p>“Those are almost identically the words I addressed
to the late Prime Minister of Fatland when,
after thirty years of prevarication, he was persuaded
to receive a deputation. I am afraid we must reject
you as a candidate for the duties for which you have
been trained. In the ordinary course you would be
put upon your trial and committed to a severe cross-examination,
an art which has been raised by us to
the pitch of perfection. As it is, we are satisfied
that you are labouring under the disadvantage of
contamination from a man-governed society and are
probably not guilty of the usual offences which render
candidates unfit. We therefore condemn you as
a man of genius, and order you to be interned in the
suburb set apart for that class.”</p>

<p>I bowed to cover my amazement, a bell was rung,
and I was conducted forth. Outside, meeting another
candidate, green with nervousness, I told him
I had been rejected, whereupon he plucked up courage
and asked me how I had managed it. I told
him to say Billy-Goat instead of Stallion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XV: MEN OF GENIUS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> not then met Hohlenheim and did not know
what a man of genius was, and for genius I still had
a superstitious reverence. Before I left the committee
hall I was given a coloured ribbon to wear
across my breast and a brass button to pin into my
hat. On the button was printed M.G. 1231.
What! said I to myself, Over a thousand men of
genius in the country! never dreaming that some of
them might be of the same kind as myself, so obstinate
are superstitions and so completely do they hide
the obvious.</p>

<p>As I passed through the streets of the capital I
found that I was the object of amused contemptuous
glances from the women, who walked busily and purposefully
along. There were no shops in the streets,
which were bordered with trees and gardens and
seemed to be very well and skilfully laid out. I was
free to go where I liked, or I thought I was, and I
determined not to go to the suburb, but to find a
lodging where I could for a while keep out of trouble
and at my leisure discover some means of getting
out of the abominable country. Coming on what
looked like an eating-house, I entered the folding
doors, but was immediately ejected by a diminutive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
portress. When I explained that I was hungry she
told me to go home.</p>

<p>I was equally unfortunate at other places, and at
last put their unkind receptions down to my badges.
Is this, I thought, how they treat their men of
genius? My applications for lodgings were no more
prosperous, and I was preparing to sleep in the
streets when I met an enormously fat man wearing
a ribbon and button like my own. He hailed me as
a comrade, flung his arm round my shoulder and
said: “The cold winds of misfortune may blow
through an æolian harp, but they make music. Ah!
Divine music, in paint, in stone, in words, and many
other different materials.” “I beg your pardon,”
said I, “but the wind of misfortune is blowing an infernal
hunger through my ribs, and I should be
obliged if you will lead me to a place where I can be
fed.” “Gladly, gladly. We immortals, living and
dead, are brothers.” So saying he led me through
a couple of gardens until we came to a village of
little red houses set round a green, in the center of
which was a statue. “Christmas!” I cried.
“Christmas it is,” said my guide, “the only statue
left in the country, save in our little community,
where the rule is, Every man his own statue.”</p>

<p>Community within community! This society in
which I was floundering was like an Indian puzzle-box
which you open and open until you come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
a little piece of cane like a slice of a dried pea.</p>

<p>However, I was too hungry to pursue reflection
any further and without more words followed my
companion into one of the little red houses, where
for the first time for many months I was face to face
with a right good meal. Here at any rate were sensible
people who had not forgotten that a man’s first
obligation is to his stomach. I ate feverishly and
paid no heed to my companions at table, two little
gentlemen whom at home I would have taken for
elderly store-clerks. When at last I spoke, one of
the little gentlemen was very excited to discover that
I was an American. “Can you tell me,” he said,
“can you tell me who are now the best sellers?”</p>

<p>“What,” I asked, “are they?”</p>

<p>They looked at each other in dismay.</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> were best sellers,” they cried in chorus.</p>

<p>After the meal they brought out volumes of cuttings
from the American newspapers, and I recognised
the names of men who had in their works
brought tears to my eyes and a smile to my lips.</p>

<p>“Do I behold,” I said, “the authors of those delightful
books which have made life sweeter for
thousands?”</p>

<p>They hung their heads modestly, each apparently
expecting the other to speak. At last my fat friend
said:</p>

<p>“Brothers, we will have a bottle of port on this.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>The port was already decanted and ready to his
hand. Over it they poured out their woes. Publication
had stopped in Fatland. There was no public,
and the public of America had been made inaccessible.
How can a man write a book without a public?
It would be sheer waste of his genius. When
a man has been paid two hundred dollars for a story
he could not be expected to work for less, could he?
I supposed not, and the little man with the long hair
and pointed Elizabethean beard cried hysterically:</p>

<p>“But these women, these harpies, expect us to
work for their bits of paper, their drafts on their
miserable stores. When they drew up their confounded
statutes they admitted genius: they acknowledged
that we should be useless on farms or in factories.
They allowed us this, the once-famous garden
suburb, for our residence and retreat, but they
made us work—work—us, the dreamers of
dreams! But what work? The sweet fruits of our
inspiration? No. We have been set to edit the
works of William Christmas, to write the biography
of William Christmas, to prepare the sayings of
William Christmas for the young. No Christmas,
no dinner, and there you are. Is such a life tolerable?”</p>

<p>“No!” cried the fat man.</p>

<p>“What is more,” continued the indignant one,
“we are asked to dwell among nincompoops who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
have never had and never could have any reputation,
young men who used to insult us in the newspapers,
cranks and faddists who have never reached the
heart of the great public and are jealous of those
who have. And these men are set to work with us
in our drudgery, and they are paid exactly at the
same rate. Fortunately many of them waste their
time in writing poetry and drama while we do their
work and make them pay in contributions to our
table. Pass the port, brother.”</p>

<p>They spent the evening reading aloud from their
volumes of press cuttings, living in the glorious past,
while they appealed to me every now and then for
news of the publishing world in America. I invented
the names of best sellers and made my hosts’
mouths water over the prices I alleged to be then
current. They were so pleased with me that they
pressed me to stay with them and to work on the new
Concordance of Christmas.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVI: REVOLUTION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Work</span> on the Index, I soon found, meant preparing
the whole mighty undertaking, while my three men
of genius smoked, ate, drank, slept, talked, and went
a-strolling in the capital. There was this advantage
about being a man of genius that I was free to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
and go as and when I liked, though I was everywhere
scoffed at and treated with good-humoured scorn. I
was always liable to insult at the hands of the high-spirited
young women of the capital who held places
in the Government offices and had acquired the insolent
manners of a ruling class. However, I soon
learned to recognise the type and to avoid an encounter,
though my poor old friends often came
home black and blue.</p>

<p>There was a great deal more sense in Christmas
than I had at first supposed, and, as I progressed
with my work, I saw that what he meant was very
near what Edmund and his father had been at,
namely, that men and women, if only they set about
it the right way, can find in each other the interest,
amusement, and imaginative zest to dispel the boredom
which is alone responsible for social calamities.
His appeal had been to men, but he had only reached
the ears of women, and they had hopelessly misunderstood
him. They had expected him to have a
new message and had taken his old wisdom for novelty
by identifying it with his personality. He had
not taken the precaution to placate the men of genius
of his time. Without a marketable reputation they
could not recognise him. They refused to acknowledge
him and drove him into the strange courses
which made him seem to the nerve-ridden women of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the country new, fresh, and Heaven-sent. Certainly
he had genius, as my professional men of
genius had it not, and it came into too direct a contact
with the public mind. The smouldering indignation
of ages burst into flame. More and more as
I worked I was filled with respect for this idealist
and with pity for the human beings who had followed
him to their undoing. His insight was remarkable,
and I made a collection of his works to
take back with me to America, if I should ever go
there.</p>

<p>I stayed in the Suburb of Genius for a couple of
years, very pleased to be away from the women, and
among people many of whom were amusing. There
were painters and sculptors, who spent their time
making Christmas portraits and effigies, cursing
like sailors as they worked. Very good company
some of these men, and most ingenious in their shifts
and devices to dodge the rules and regulations with
which they were hemmed in. Some of them had
smuggled women into their houses and lived in a
very charming domesticity. I envied them and was
filled with longing for my home.</p>

<p>One day as I was at my work I came on an unpublished
manuscript of Christmas. It contained a
poem which I liked and a saying which fired me.
This was the poem:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The woman’s spirit kindles man’s desire,</div>
<div class="verse">And both are burned up by a quenchless fire.</div>
<div class="verse">Let but the woman set her spirit free,</div>
<div class="verse">Then it is man’s unto eternity.</div>
<div class="verse">It is a world within his hands, and there</div>
<div class="verse">They two may dwell encircled in a square.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I could never quite make sense of it, but it seized
my imagination as nonsense sometimes will, and prepared
it for the convulsion which was to happen.</p>

<p>This was the saying:</p>

<p>“There will come one after me who shall build
where I have destroyed, and he shall capture the
flame wherewith I have burned away the dying
thoughts of men.”</p>

<p>The words haunted me. They were in none of
the Christmas books, nor in the biography. I inserted
it in the Concordance and in a new edition of
the Speeches, on my own responsibility and without
saying a word to my employers. There might or
might not be trouble, but I knew that the Chairwoman
of the Governing Committee was a vain old
creature and would take the words to mean herself.
To my mind they pointed straight to Edmund. I
knew that his cause was gaining ground and that, if
I could gain sufficient publicity for the saying, his
following would be vastly increased.</p>

<p>I was on good terms with the chief of the publishing
department and was able to persuade her to announce
that the new edition of the Speeches was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
only one authorised by the Governing Committee;
all others to be called in. The success of my trick
exceeded all my dreams. There was something like
an exodus from the capital.</p>

<p>I met my dear Audrey one day. She had come to
spy out the land. Her news was glorious. For
miles round the once ruined city the farms were occupied
with happy men and women working together
to supply food for the towns, which in return furnished
their wants from its workshops, which the
toilers filled with song as they worked. The fame
of it was everywhere growing. Other ruined cities
had been occupied. Two of the great nunneries
were deserted. Edmund with a great company of
young men had taken possession of a town by the
sea and opened the harbour and released the ships.</p>

<p>“Ships!” I said. “There are ships sailing on
the sea!”</p>

<p>That settled it. No more men of genius for me.
That night I spent in chalking up the saying of William
Christmas on the walls of the capital. The
next morning I was with Audrey wandering about
the streets, hearing Edmund’s name on all lips, and
then, satisfied that all would be well, I made for the
sea-board.</p>

<p>It was good to see America again, but I suffered
there as acutely as I had done in Fatland. I had
been among women who, if misguided, were free.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
My dear wife and I could never understand one another
and she died within a very few years after my
return of a broken heart. I thought I could not survive
her, and should not have done but for my fortunate
encounter with Hohlenheim, who could understand
my loathing of woman in Fatland, of man in
America, draw it up into his own matchless imagination
and distil the passion of it into beauty.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">I: MR. BLY’S HEART BREAKS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a little house, one of many such houses, in a town,
one of many such towns in Fatland, sat Nicholas Bly,
a small stationer and newsagent, by the bedside of
his wife. She said: “Ain’t I thin, Nick?” and
again she said: “My hair is only half what it
was.” And he said: “It’s very pretty hair.”
She smiled and took his hand in hers and she died.
When Nicholas Bly was quite sure that she was
dead, when he could believe that she was dead, he
did not weep, for there were no tears in his eyes.
He said nothing, for there were no words in his
mind. He felt nothing, for his heart was breaking,
and so little was he alive that he did not know it.
His wife was dead, his two children were dead, his
shop was closed, and he had two shillings in the
world, and they were borrowed.</p>

<p>He went out into the street and when he saw a
well-fed man he hated him: and when he saw a thin
hungry man he despised him; on returning to his
house he found there a Doctor and a Parson. The
Doctor said his wife had died of something with two
long Latin names.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“She starved,” said Nicholas Bly.</p>

<p>The Parson said something about the will and the
love of God.</p>

<p>“The devil’s took her,” said Nicholas Bly.</p>

<p>The Parson cast up his eyes and exhorted the
blasphemer to seek comfort in duty and distraction
in hard work.</p>

<p>“I’m out of work,” said Nicholas Bly; “the
devil’s took my work and my wife and my two children.
Hell’s full up and overflowed into this ’ere
town and this ’ere street. We must fight the devil
with fire and bloody murders.”</p>

<p>The Parson and the Doctor agreed that the poor
fellow was mad.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">II: MR. BLY IS IMPRISONED</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas Bly’s</span> stomach was full of emptiness, the
heat of his blood parched his brains, and his sleep
was crowded with huddling bad dreams. He ate
crusts and cabbage stalks picked up out of the gutter,
and when he was near mad with thirst he
snatched beer jugs from children as they turned
into the entries leading to their houses. His days
he spent looking for the devil. Three nights he
spent moving from one square with seats round it to
another, and on the fourth night he heard of a brick-field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
where there was some warmth. He slept there
that night and was arrested. The magistrate said:</p>

<p>“I am satisfied that you are a thoroughly worthless
character, an incurable vagabond, and if not yet
a danger, a nuisance to society....”</p>

<p>(The magistrate said a great deal more. He was
newly appointed and needed to persuade himself of
his dignity by talk.)</p>

<p>Nicholas Bly was sent to prison.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">III: THE DARK GENTLEMAN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he left the prison Nicholas Bly realised that
he had legs to walk with but nowhere to go, hands
to work with but nothing to do, a brain to think with
but never a thought. He was almost startled to
find himself utterly alone, and his loneliness drove
him into a hot rage. In prison he had thought
vaguely of the world as a warm place outside, to
which in the course of days he would return. Now
that he had returned the world had nothing to do
with him and he had nothing to do with it. He
prowled through the streets, but a sort of pride forbade
him to eat the cabbage stalks and crusts of the
gutters, and to rob children of their parents’ beer
he was ashamed. He looked for work, but was
everywhere refused, and he said to himself:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Prison is the best the world can do for men like
me.”</p>

<p>But he was determined to give the world a better
reason for putting him in prison than sleeping in a
brick-field because it was warm. The world was
cold. He would make it warm. The devil was in
the world: he would burn him out, use his own element
against him.</p>

<p>He chose the largest timber-yard he could find,
and that night he stole a can of petrol, and when he
had placed it in a heap of shavings went out into the
street to find some matches. He met a seedy individual
in a coat with a fur collar and a broad-brimmed
hat, who looked like an actor, and he asked
him if he could oblige him with a match.</p>

<p>“Lucifers,” said the seedy individual and gave
him three.</p>

<p>Nicholas Bly returned to the timber-yard with the
matches. He struck one. It went off like a rocket.
The second exploded like a Chinese cracker, and he
was just lighting the third when he heard a melancholy
chuckle. He turned his head and found the
seedy individual gazing at him with an expression of
wistfulness.</p>

<p>“Like old times,” said the seedy individual.</p>

<p>Nicholas Bly lit the third match and it flooded the
whole yard with Bengal light, and still he had not set
fire to his petrol.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Gimme another match,” said Nicholas Bly;
“watch me set fire to the yard and go and tell.”</p>

<p>“I have no more,” replied the stranger.
“Those were my last. I no longer make fire or instruments
of fire. No one wants my tricks. I have
lost everything and am doomed.”</p>

<p>“I have lost my wife, my children and my work.”</p>

<p>“I have lost my kingdom, my power and my
glory.”</p>

<p>“The devil took them,” answered Nicholas Bly.</p>

<p>“I wish I had,” replied the stranger.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IV: THE DARK GENTLEMAN’S STORY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas Bly</span> fetched a screech loud enough to
wake a whole parish. The dark gentleman pounced
on him firmly and gagged him with his hand, and his
fingers burnt into the newsagent’s cheek.</p>

<p>“Be silent,” said the dark gentleman, “you’ll
have them coming and taking you away from me.
Will you be silent?”</p>

<p>Nicholas Bly nodded to say he would be silent.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“If you didn’t take them, who did?”</p>

<p>“Jah!” said the devil, for the dark gentleman
was no other. “Jah took them. Jah does everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
now, at least I am forced to the conclusion that
he does, since I find everything going on much the
same. I knew how it would be. I knew he would
find it dull only dealing with virtuous people. It
was very sudden. I was deposed without any notice
just in the middle of the busiest time I’d had for
centuries. I have had a horrible time. No one believed
in me. For years now I have only been used
to frighten children, and have occasionally been allowed
to slip into their dreams. You must agree
that it is galling for one who has lived on the fat of
human faith—for in the good old days I had far
more souls than Jah. I haven’t been in a grown
man’s mind for years until I found yours open to
me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Nicholas Bly.
“I want my wife. I want my two children. I
want my work.”</p>

<p>“Anything may be possible if you will believe in
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll believe in anything, I’d go to Hell if I could
get them back.”</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>“There is no Hell,” said the devil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">V: COGITATION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a little difficult for Nicholas Bly. For a
long time they sat brooding in the darkness of the
timber-yard. Then said Nicholas Bly:</p>

<p>“Seeing’s believing. I see you. I believe in you.
You’re the first critter that’s spoke to me honest and
kindly this many a long day. You seem to be worse
off than I am. We’re mates.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the devil. “In the old days
I used to offer those who believed in me women,
wine, song and riches. But now we shall have to see
what we can do.”</p>

<p>“I want to spite that there Jah.”</p>

<p>“We will do our best,” said the devil.</p>

<p>With that they rose to their feet, and as they left
the timber-yard the devil shook a spark out of his
tail on to the petrol, so that they had not gone above
a mile when the wood was ablaze and they could see
the red glow of the fire against the sky.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VI: CONFLAGRATION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Gleefully</span> the devil took Mr. Bly back to watch
the blaze, and they were huddled and squeezed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
pressed in the crowd. A fat woman took a fancy to
the devil and put her arm round his waist.</p>

<p>“Where are you living, old dear?” she said.</p>

<p>“You leave my pal alone,” said Nicholas Bly.</p>

<p>But the devil gave her a smacking kiss, and she
slapped his face and giggled, saying:</p>

<p>“Geeh! That was a warm one that was.”</p>

<p>And she persisted until the devil had confessed
his name to be Mr. Nicodemus. Then she said she
had a snug little room in her house which he could
have—his pal too if they were not to be separated.</p>

<p>Mr. Bly demurred, but Mr. Nicodemus said:</p>

<p>“You can only get at Jah through the women.”</p>

<p>So they pursued the adventure and went home
with the fat woman, but when she reached her parlour
she plumped down on her knees and said her
prayers, and the devil vanished, and she was so enraged
that she swept Nicholas Bly out with her
broom. He hammered on her door and told her
why his friend had vanished, and that if she would
say her prayers backward he would return. She
said her prayers backwards and Mr. Nicodemus returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VII: TIB STREET</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fat woman’s name was Mrs. Martin, and when
she found that her beloved had a tail she was not at
all put out, but to avoid scandal, cut it off.</p>

<p>All the same there was a scandal, for the fascination
of Mr. Nicodemus was irresistible, and the
house was always full of women, and whenever he
went out he was followed by a herd of them. Mrs.
Martin was jealous, Mr. Bly sulked and Mr. Nicodemus
had a busy time placating indignant husbands
and lovers. Not a house in Tib street but
was in a state of upheaval. The men sought consolation
in drink, and presently there was hardly one
who had retained his work.</p>

<p>“We are getting on,” said Mr. Nicodemus.
“We are getting on. In the good old times men
left their work to follow me, and it used to be a favourite
device of mine to make their work seem so
repulsive to them that they preferred thieving or
fighting or even suffering to it. If we end as we
have begun, then Jah will be as isolated as you and
I have been.”</p>

<p>And he chuckled in triumph and bussed Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“That,” said she, “reminds me of Martin; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
he was a oner, he was. That’s worth anything to
me.”</p>

<p>With that the good creature bustled off to arrange
for a week’s charing to keep her lodgers in food.</p>

<p>Shortlived, however was the triumph of Mr.
Nicodemus, for, with the women neglecting their
homes and the men their work, the children sickened
and died, and no day passed but two or three little
coffins were taken to the cemetery. And in their
grief the women remembered Jah, and went to
church to appease His wrath. The men were sobered
and returned to work, but at wages punitively
reduced, so that their last state was worse than their
first, for the women were now devoted to Jah and
the children were empty and their bellies were
pinched.</p>

<p>Nicholas Bly cursed Jah. The sight of the little
coffins being taken out of Tib Street reminded him
of his own children and he went near mad and
vowed that Jah was taking them because He was a
jealous God, one who had taken Hell from the devil
and their children from men in the purblindness of
His fury.</p>

<p>And he began to preach at the corner of Tib
Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">VIII: MR. BLY’S SERMON</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> said:</p>

<p>“There are many filthy streets in this town, but
this is the filthiest. Who made it filthy? Jah! It
is the nature of man to love his wife and his children,
to dwell with them in peace and loving-kindness.
But for all his love, wherewith shall a man feed his
wife and children? What clothing shall he give
them? What shelter find for them? Go you into
this street and look into the houses. You will find
crumbling walls, broken stairs, windows stuffed with
clouts: you will find bare shelves and cupboards: you
will find dead children with never so much as a whole
shroud among them. You will say that perhaps
they are better dead, but I say unto you that if a
man’s children be dead wherewith shall he feed his
love? And without a full love in his heart how
shall a man work or live or die? Are we born only
to die? And if life ends in death what matters it
how life be lived? But, I say unto you, that because
life ends in death a man must see to it that all his
days are filled with love, which is beauty, which is
truth. And I say unto you when your eyes are filled
and bleeding with the pain of the sights you shall see
here, go out into the fields and to the hills and the
great waters and see the sun rise and shed his light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and go down and cast his light upon the moon, and
draw vapour from the earth and bring it again in the
rain; and feel the wind upon your faces, and see the
sodden air hang upon the earth until the coming of
the storm to cleanse its foulness: and do you mark
the flight of the birds, the nesting of the birds, the
happy fish in the waters, the slow beasts in the fields:
observe the growth of trees and plants, and grasses
and corn. Then you shall know the richness of love
among the creatures that know not Jah. They die
and are visited with sickness even as we, but theirs is
a free life and a free death unconfined by any sickness
of the mind or tyranny of Gods and Demons.
We alone among creatures are cheated of our desires
and perish for the want of food amid plenty, and are
cut off each from his full share of the abounding love
of the world. Who takes our share? Jah! Who
kills our love? Jah! Who filches the best of our
thoughts, the keenest sap of our courage? Who
fills our lives and homes with darkness and despair,
and meanness and emptiness? Jah! I know not
who Jah is, nor whence He came, but I will dethrone
Him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">IX: THE EFFECT OF MR. BLY’S
SERMON</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Street</span> oratory was at that time very common, but
there was a note in Mr. Bly’s eloquence which attracted
many of the inhabitants of the district, especially
the young, and he achieved a certain fame.
No one knew exactly what he was talking about, for,
except for expletive purposes, the word Jah had
dropped out of the vernacular. Mr. Bly was assumed
to be some kind of politician, and he was certainly
more exciting than most. Therefore his audiences
were twice as large as those of any other
speaker. Seeing this, a Labour Agitator came to
him and offered him a place on his committee and a
pound a week as a lecturer.</p>

<p>“I can speak about nothing but Jah,” said Mr.
Bly.</p>

<p>“Speak about anything you like so long as you
catch their ears,” said the agitator.</p>

<p>So Mr. Bly accepted the offer.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">X: THE WIDOW MARTIN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Bly told his infernal companion of his
engagement Mr. Nicodemus said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Talking is a very human way of creating a disturbance.
My way and Jah’s way is the way of
corruption. We unseat the mind and poison the
soul with unsatisfiable desires. But if you wish it I
will go with you. We have lit a fire in Tib Street
that will burn itself out without us.”</p>

<p>“I should like your company,” replied Mr. Bly.
“It helps me to be reminded that Jah has been unjust
to more than human beings. It redoubles my
fury and kindles my eloquence. I am determined to
earn my pound a week and drive Jah out of the
land.”</p>

<p>The devil began to draw on his shabby fur coat.
Mrs. Martin had been listening to their conversation.
She burst in upon them and vowed that her
Nick should never, never leave her. With horrible
callousness Mr. Nicodemus told her that he was
pledged to Mr. Bly, and asked her for his tail. She
refused to give it up, and was so stubborn that, at
last, after they had argued with her, and pleaded
and stormed, and bribed and bullied, she said she
would produce his tail if she might go with them;
and they consented, for Mr. Nicodemus said that if
he were ever returned to power he would be in need
of his tail, and indeed would be a ridiculous object
without it, his system of damnation being supported
by tradition and symbol and ritual.</p>

<p>They had a merry supper-party, and that night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
took train for the town appointed for Mr. Bly’s first
appearance on a political platform.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XI: MAKING A STIR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> other politicians dealt in statistics, which,
after all, are but an intellectual excitement, a kind
of mental cats’-cradle, our orator sounded three
notes: he appealed to a man’s love of women, his
love of children, and led his audience on to hatred of
Jah. To the first two they responded, were persuaded
that they were as he said, cheated and betrayed,
and, though they could not follow him further
without losing their heads, they lost them and
were filled with hatred. And as Mr. Bly never
made any reference either to Government or Opposition
his speeches were reported in the newspapers
on both sides, and aroused the greatest interest
through the country. The well-to-do found breakfast
insipid without his utterances, and, to support
him, they subscribed largely to the funds of the organisation
which promoted his efforts. His salary
was raised to two pounds a week on the day when a
Conservative organ published his portrait and a
leading article on the golden sincerity of the Working
Classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XII: MAKING A STIRABOUT</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> other orators damned everything from sewing
cotton to battleships, and so could not avoid
giving offence, Mr. Bly damned only Jah and hurt
nobody’s feelings. But he produced an effect. He
laid every grievance at Jah’s door, and roused so
much enthusiasm that at last he began to believe in
his power.</p>

<p>It is not often that the people find a leader, and
when they do they expect him to lead. They were
impatient for Mr. Bly to reveal to them a line of action,
and here he was puzzled. It was one thing
(he found) to talk about Jah, another to bring Jah
to book. He had no other machinery than that of
the Labour Agitators, who had been making elaborate
preparations for a strike. Their preparations
were excellent, but their followers were reluctant.
They could provide them with no adequate motive.
In vain did they talk of the dawn of Labour, the
Rights of the Worker, and a Place in the Sun; to all
these the people preferred the prospect of pay on
Saturday. Nothing could stir them, until, at last,
at one of Mr. Bly’s meetings when he was being
hailed as a leader and implored to lead, and at his
wit’s end what to do, upon a whisper from behind,
he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Strike! Strike against Jah! You are workers!
Why do you work? To feed your children.
Your children die. Strike, I say, strike while the
iron is hot, the iron that has entered into your souls
from the cruel tyranny of Jah! There is no other
enemy. You have no other foe....”</p>

<p>He did not need to say more. The fat was in the
fire.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIII. SPARKS FLYING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fat crackled and sputtered. In thirty-six
hours the business of the town was at a standstill,
and by that time Mr. Bly had visited three other
towns, and they too succumbed to his passion. At
every town he visited he was welcomed with brass
bands and red carpets, and his orders were obeyed.
The Labour Agitators of the neighbouring countries
desired his services and cabled for him, and he promised
to go as soon as Jah was driven out of Fatland.</p>

<p>The strikes were begun in feasting and merrymaking,
and things were done that delighted Mr.
Nicodemus and the widow Martin’s heart:</p>

<p>“The men are becoming quite themselves again.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Nicodemus gazed upon it all and sighed:</p>

<p>“Ah! If only Hell were open!”</p>

<p>The widow Martin gazed upon him voluptuously
and muttered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“It would be just ’Eaven to keep that public
you’re always talking about for ever and ever with
you.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIV: SMOULDERING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> strikers soon came to grips with want and the
very poor were brought to starvation. Only the
more fiercely for that did their passion glow. They
forgot all about Mr. Bly and Jah: they were only
determined not to give in. They knew not wherefore
they were fighting, and were savagely resolved
not to return to their old ways without some palpable
change. Forces and emotions had been
stirred which led them to look for a miracle, and
without the miracle they preferred to die. The
miracle did not come and many of them died.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XV: SUCCOUR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a moderate but assured income the Fattish
are humane, that is to say, they grope like shadows
through life and shun the impenetrable shadow of
death. They shuddered to think of the very poor
dying with their eyes gazing forward for the miracle
that never came, and they said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“To think of their finding no miracle but death!
It is too horrible. Can such things be in Fatland?
Why don’t we do something?”</p>

<p>So they formed committees and wrote to the
newspapers and started various funds; and they invited
Mr. Bly to lecture in aid of them.</p>

<p>He came to Bondon, lectured, and became the
fashion. He discovered to his amazement that
there were rich people in Fatland, and these rich
people formed Anti-Jah societies. Enormous sums
of money were collected for the strikers, because
the rich were so delighted to be amused. Mr. Bly
amused them enormously. Mr. Nicodemus gave a
course of lectures on the Kingdom from which Jah
had deposed him, and Mrs. Martin held meetings for
women only, to expound her views of men. For
years the rich people had not been so vastly entertained,
and they poured out money for the strikers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately their subscriptions could buy little
else for the very poor but coffins, and of them the
supply soon came to an end.</p>

<p>Famine and pestilence stalked abroad, but only
the more fiercely did Mr. Bly urge the destruction
of Jah, and the more blindly and desperately did the
starving poor of Fatland look for the miracle.</p>

<p>But soon not only were the poor starving, but the
comfortable, the tradespeople, the professional
classes, the humane persons with moderate but assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
incomes were faced with want. Rats were
now five shillings a brace, and a nest of baby mice
was known to fetch four shillings.</p>

<p>When the rich found their meals were costing
them more than a pound a head then they forgot
their craze and Mr. Bly, and Mr. Nicodemus and
the widow Martin withdrew from Bondon. Mr.
Bly was no longer reported in the newspapers. His
name had become offensive, the bloom had gone
from his novelty, the varnish from his reputation,
and the sting out of his power.</p>

<p>In all the towns gaunt spectre-like men began to
sneak back to work, and Mr. Bly was nigh frenzied
with rage, disgust and despair.</p>

<p>“It is Jah!” he said. “It is Jah. He has crept
into the hearts of men. He has stirred their minds
against me. Oh! my grief. He has used me to
bring men lower yet, so that they will live in viler
dwellings, and eat of fouler food, and be more
meanly clad, more verminous than ever. The
women will be lower sluts and shrews than they have
ever been, and of their children it will be hard to
see how they can ever grow into men and women.
Deeper and deeper into the pit has Jah brought us,
and there is now no hope.”</p>

<p>And in his agony he remembered how in his childhood
he had been taught to pray to Jah, and he
knelt and prayed that he might come face to face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
with Jah, to tell Him what He had done, and to implore
Him to make an end of His cruelty and to destroy
all at once.</p>

<p>Hearing him pray Mr. Nicodemus fled from his
side and left him alone with the Widow Martin.
Said she:</p>

<p>“Don’t take on so, dearie. A man’s no call to
take on so when he has a woman by his side.
There’s nothing else in the nature of things, but men
and women only. If we starve, we starve: and if
we die, we die, it’s all one. Have done, I say,
there’s always room for a bit o’ fun.”</p>

<p>“Fun!” cried Mr. Bly.</p>

<p>And the comfortable creature took his head to
her bosom, and there he sobbed out his grief.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVI: ON THE ROAD</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> the strike ended, and Nicholas Bly walked from
town to town marking its effects. It was as he had
foreseen, and men were lower than before, and
every night he prayed that he might meet Jah to
curse Him to His face. For days on end he would
utter never a word, but the widow Martin stayed
with him and saw that he ate and drank, stealing,
begging, wheedling, selling herself to get him food.
She would say:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“It’s not like Mr. Nicodemus. There’s very
little fun in him, but a woman doesn’t care for fun
when she’s sorry for a man.”</p>

<p>He was a grim sight now, was Nicholas Bly. His
ragged clothes hung and flapped on him as on a
scarecrow. His cheeks were sunken and patched
with a dirty grey stubble. His eyes glared feverishly
out of red sockets, and they seemed to see
nothing but to be asking for a sight of something.
There was a sort of film on them, but the light in the
man shone through it. His shoulders were bowed
and his thin arms hung limply by his side, but always
his face was upturned, and he shook as he walked,
like a flame.</p>

<p>The malady in him drove him to the heights.
His desire was to be near the sky. Presently he
forsook the towns and went from one range of hills
to another seeking the highest in Fatland.</p>

<p>At last after many days he reached the highest
hill, and there he lay flat on his face and would
neither eat nor drink. By his side sat the widow
Martin, and she made certain that he was going to
die, and produced two pennies to lay upon his eyelids
when death should come.</p>

<p>On the third day he turned over on his back and
said:</p>

<p>“Jah is coming.”</p>

<p>And it was so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Up the steep path came a man with a great beard
and a huge nose and eyes that twinkled with the
light of merriment and shone with the tenderness of
irony, and blazed with the fire of genius. By his
side walked a slim dark figure, and with a joyful cry
the widow Martin declared it to be Mr. Nicodemus.</p>

<p>Nicholas Bly sat up and began to rehearse all the
curses that in his bitterness he had prepared.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVII: JAH</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> began:</p>

<p>“By the dead bodies of the children of men; by
the plagues and diseases of the bodies of women;
by the festering——”</p>

<p>Very quietly Jah took His seat by his side and motioned
to Mr. Nicodemus to take up his position in
front of them. In a voice of the most musical
sweetness and with a rich full diction He said:</p>

<p>“As we made the ascent I was expostulating with
my friend here for the absurdity of his attempt to
reinstate himself in the world. There is no Hell.
Neither is there a Heaven. These places live by
faith as we have done. It is a little difficult for us
to understand, but we have no occasion for resentment.
Separately it is impossible for us to understand.
My meeting with my dark friend here led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
me a little way on the road towards a solution. The
four of us may arrive at something.”</p>

<p>The widow Martin scanned Jah closely:</p>

<p>“You’ve been a fine man in your time.”</p>

<p>“I have never been a man,” replied Jah sadly.
“Nor have I been able to play my part in human affairs.
Like my friend here I have been an exile. I
have been forced to dwell in the mists of superstition,
even as he has been confined in the dark depths
of lust. Until now I never understood our interdependence.
I am the imagination of man. He is
man’s passion. Together we can bring about the
release of love in his soul. Separately we can do
nothing to break his folly, his stupidity, his brutality,
his vain selfishness. Without us he can be inquisitive
and clever, vigorous and energetic, but he remains
insensible, unjust, cruel and cowardly.”</p>

<p>And Nicholas Bly roused himself and he seemed
to grow, and the film fell from his eyes and he cried:</p>

<p>“Blessed be Jah, blessed be Nicodemus, blessed
be man and the heart of man, blessed be woman
and the love of woman, blessed be life, blessed be
death!”</p>

<p>So saying he rose to his feet. Before his face the
sun was sinking in the evening glory: behind him the
moon rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XVIII: JAH SPEAKS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> wind blew through Nicholas Bly’s hair and
he bowed his head in acceptance of the wonder of
the universe.</p>

<p>As the moon rose to her zenith Jah said:</p>

<p>“There are Wonders beyond me and God is beyond
imagination. My dwelling is in the mind of
men, but I have been driven therefrom. My friend
here should dwell in the heart of man, but he has
been unseated. Together we should win for man his
due share of the world’s dominion and power, and
should be his sweetest stops in the instrument of life.
For without us is no joy, and with us joy is fierce.
I speak, of the woman also, for she is the equal of
man and his comrade.”</p>

<p>And as the moon was sinking to the west Jah said:</p>

<p>“We have suffered too long, and we have brought
forth nothing. Let us no longer be separate, but
let us, man, woman, God and Devil, join together to
bring forth joy, for until there is joy on earth there
shall not be justice, nor kindness, nor understanding,
nor any good thing. We are but one spirit, for the
spirit is one, and none but the undivided spirit can
see the light of the sun.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the sun came up in his majesty,
dwarfing the mighty hills, and Nicholas Bly raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
his head and saw Nicodemus in the likeness of a lusty
young man, fine and splendid in his desire, and Jah
in the shape of a winged boy. And as he saw them
they disappeared, and he said:</p>

<p>“They have vanished into the air.”</p>

<p>From the scarred hillside came an echo:</p>

<p>“Into the air.”</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XIX: SONG</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> did Nicholas Bly sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“I have lived, I have loved, I have died,</div>
<div class="indent">And my spirit has burned like a flame;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I have glowed to the winds of my own desire,</div>
<div class="indent">I have flickered and flared and roared,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XX: MORNING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Waking</span>, the woman said:</p>

<p>“How is it with you, my man?”</p>

<p>He answered:</p>

<p>“I feel truly that I am a man.”</p>

<p>Gazing upon the woman, he saw that she was
beautiful.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">XXI: HOPE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> came down from the hills, and a mist descended
upon them, and presently a driving rain.
They were glad of each other, and smiled their joy
upon all whom they met. Nicholas Bly never
ceased to make songs, and as he sang the woman
laughed merrily. The songs he made he sang to
many men, but none would listen except the drunken
man in the public-houses.</p>

<p>One day a very drunken man asked Nicholas Bly
to sing a song again, and he refused, because he
wished to sing a better song. The man offered him
a mug of beer to sing again, but he refused, saying:</p>

<p>“I do not sing for hire.”</p>

<p>The man despised him and drank the beer himself,
saying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“It’s a silly kind of sod will sing for nothing.”</p>

<p>And he would hear no more.</p>

<p>So it was everywhere. None could understand
that Nicholas Bly should sing for the delight of it or
that there could be a joy to set him singing. In the
end, and that soon, his heart broke and he died, and
Fatland is as it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicodemus and Jah were never seen again,
nor in Fatland is there trace or memory of them.</p>

<p>But within the womb of the woman was the child
of her man, so that she gazed in upon herself with
a great hope. In this she was so absorbed that the
insensibility of the Fattish moved her not at all and
she forgot to apply for her maternity benefit.</p>
